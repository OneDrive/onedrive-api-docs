# Timestamp type

The **Timestamp** type represents date and time information for the
OneDrive API, by using
[ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format and is always
in UTC time.

For example, if a file was modified at midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014, the metadata
would look like this.

<!-- {"blockType": "ignored"} -->
```json
{
  "dateTimeLastModified": "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

<!-- {
  "type": "#page.annotation",
  "description": "Timestamps in OneDrive as in ISO 8601 format.",
  "keywords": "timestamp,iso8601",
  "section": "documentation",
