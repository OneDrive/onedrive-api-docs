# Sending a Sharing Invitation (Preview)

The invite action is used to add additional permissions to an existing item
and optionally notify the recipient of those permissions they have access to
the item via email.

Using the invite action is more secure than [creating a sharing link](sharing_createLink.md),
because the permissions are only valid for the recipient and cannot be used by others.

**Note:** This functionality is a preview and should only be used for evaluating
and testing. Some details of this API are expected to be changed before this
functionality is finally released.
