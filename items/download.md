# Download a OneDrive Item contents

Use this API to download the contents for an item with the [File][file-facet] facet.

## Prerequisites
To call the download API, the user must have granted the application read access
to the file the app wishes to download.

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /drive/items/{item-id}/content
GET /drive/root:/{path and filename}:/content
```

### Optional request headers

| Name            | Value | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|:----------------|:------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| _if-none-match_ | etag  | If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided matches the current tag on the file, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |
| _range_         | range | Range of bytes returned in the response.                                                                                                   |

### Request body

Do not supply a request body with this method.

### Example

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "download-item-content", "scopes": "files.read" } -->
```http
GET /drive/items/{item-id}/content
```

## Response

Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL
for the file. This is the same URL available through the `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl`
property on an item.

To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow
the `Location` header in the response.

Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few
minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmagahszhxzlcvhasdhasghasodfi
```

## Range downloads

To download a partial range of an item, you use the `Range` HTTP header
as specified in [RFC 2616][rfc-2616]. Note that you must append the `Range`
header to the HTTP request after receiving the `302 Found` redirection.

[rfc-2616]: https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "download-item-partial" } -->
```http
GET https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmag
Range: bytes=0-1023
```

This will return an `HTTP 206 Partial Content` response with the request
range of bytes from the file. If the range cannot be generated the `Range`
header may be ignored and an HTTP 200 response would be returned with the
full contents of the file.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "name": "download-item-partial", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/2048

<first 1024 bytes of file>
```

### Error responses

See [Error Responses][error-response] for more info about
how errors are returned.

## Remarks

When you download an item's content by requesting its `/content` property, you
must provide the Authorization header, in order to be granted access to download.
The response would normally return a `302` redirect to the URL where the file
can be downloaded from. This URL is pre-authenticated and does not require the
Authorization header.
