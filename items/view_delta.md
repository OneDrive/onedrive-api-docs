# View changes for a OneDrive Item and its children

This method allows your app to enumerate the changes under a OneDrive folder
from an earlier state, represented by a delta token. This enables your app to
maintain a local representation of the contents of a drive and update the local
state efficiently.

## HTTP request

````
GET /drive/items/{item-id}/delta
GET /drive/root:/{item-path}:/delta
````

### Optional query string parameters

| Name      | Value  | Description                                                                                                                          |
|:----------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **top**   | number | The desired number of items to return in the next page. Note: `delta` may end up returning more or fewer.                       |

### Example

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-delta", "idempotent": true, "scopes": "files.read", "target": "action" } -->
```
GET /drive/items/{item-id}/delta
Accept: application/json
```

### Response

If successful, this call returns a [Delta Response object][delta-resource]
which contains a collection of [driveItem resources][item-resource] representing the
current state of each item. The collection also includes the additional
properties shown in the next table.

| Name                 | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                      |
|:---------------------|:-------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **value**            | array  | An array of [driveItem][item-resource] resources which have been created, modified, or deleted.                                                  |
| **@odata.nextLink**  | url    | A URL to retrieve the next available page of changes, if there are additional changes in the current set.                                        |
| **@odata.deltaLink** | url    | A URL returned instead of **@odata.nextLink** after all current changes have been returned. Used to read the next set of changes in the future.  |

Your app begins by calling `delta` without any parameters.
The service starts enumerating the folder's hierarchy, returning pages of items and either an `@odata.nextLink` or an `@odata.deltaLink`, as described above.
Your app should continue calling `delta` either with the `@odata.nextLink` until you no longer see an `@odata.nextLink` returned, or you see a response with an empty set of changes.
After you have finished receiving all the changes, you may apply them to your local state.
To check for changes in the future, call `delta` by requesting the URL from `@odata.deltaLink`.

Deleted items are returned with a `deleted` facet. 
Items with this facet should be removed from your local state. 
Note: you should only delete a folder locally if it is empty after syncing all the changes.
If your local state indicates there are still items in the folder when it should be removed, a sync state error has occured and your app should start over to verify the local sync state.

}
```

**Notes:**

* The Response object is truncated for clarity. All default properties will be
  returned from the actual call.
* The delta feed shows the latest state for each item, not each change. If an
  item were renamed twice, it would only show up once, with its latest name.
* The same item may appear more than once in a delta feed, for various reasons.
  You should use the last occurrence you see.
* The `parentReference` property on items will not include a value for `path`.
  This occurs because renaming a folder does not result in any descendants of
  the folder being returned from delta. When using delta you should
  always track items by id.

There may be cases when the service can't provide a list of changes for a given
token (for example, if a client tries to reuse an old token after being
disconnected for a long time, or if server state has changed and a new token is
required). In these cases the service will return an `HTTP 410 Gone` error with
an [error response][error-response] containing one of the error codes below,
and a `Location` header containing a new nextLink that starts a fresh delta
enumeration from scratch. After finishing the full enumeration, compare the
returned items with your local state and follow these instructions.

| Error Type                       | Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|:---------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ResyncChangesApplyDifferences`  | Replace any local items with the server's version (including deletes) if you're sure that the service was up to date with your local changes when you last sync'd. Upload any local changes that the server doesn't know about. |
| `ResyncChangesUploadDifferences` | Upload any local items that the service did not return, and upload any files that differ from the server's version (keeping both copies if you're not sure which one is more up-to-date).                                       |


### Retrieving just the latest deltaLink
It is possible to retrieve just the latest deltaLink, without first enumerating all of the items.
This can be useful if your app only wants to know about changes, and doesn't care about any existing items. 
To retrieve the latest deltaLink, call `delta` with a query string parameter `token=latest`.

**Note: If you are trying to maintain a full local representation of the items in a folder or a drive, you must use `delta` for the initial enumeration.
Other approaches, such as paging through the `children` collection of a folder, are not guaranteed to return every single item if any writes take place during the enumeration. 
Using `delta` is the only way to guarantee that you've read all of the data you need to.**

#### Example

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-delta-latest", "scope": "files.read", "target": "action" } -->
```
GET /drive/root/delta?token=latest
Accept: application/json
```

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "oneDrive.viewDelta" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
    "value": [ ],
    "@odata.deltaLink": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/drive/root/delta?token=1230919asd190410jlka"
}
```

### Error responses

In addition to the resync errors detailed above, see [Error Responses][error-response] for details about how errors are returned.

[delta-resource]: ../resources/viewDeltaResource.md
[error-response]: ../misc/errors.md
[item-resource]: ../resources/item.md

## Remarks

In OneDrive for Business, `delta` is only supported on the `root` folder, not on individual folders within a drive.
The `delta` API will not return the following [Item properties](../resources/item.md):

* **createdBy**
* **eTag**
* **fileSystemInfo**
* **lastModifiedBy**

The `delta` API is not supported on SharePoint Server 2016.
