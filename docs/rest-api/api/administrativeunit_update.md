## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /administrativeUnits/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name      |Description|
|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body

In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|description|string|Description for the administrative unit.|
|displayName|string|Display name for the administrative unit.|
|visibility|string|Visibility for the administrative unit. If not set then the default is "public". Can be set to "HiddenMembership", which hides the membership from non-members.|

Since the **administrativeUnit** resource supports [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **administrativeUnit** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.
