# Create outlookTask

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Create an Outlook task in the default task group (`My Tasks`) and default task folder (`Tasks`) in the user's mailbox.

The POST method always ignores the time portion of **startDateTime** and **dueDateTime** in the request body, and assumes the time 
to be always midnight in the specified time zone.

By default, this operation (and the GET, PATCH, and [complete](../api/outlooktask_complete.md) task operations) returns date-related properties in UTC. 
You can use the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to have all the date-related properties in the response represented in a time zone 
different than UTC.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/outlook/tasks
```
## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Prefer: outlook.timezone | Specifies the time zone for time properties in the response, which would be in UTC if this header is not specified. Optional.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [outlookTask](../resources/outlooktask.md) object.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [outlookTask](../resources/outlooktask.md) object in the response body.

## Example
##### Request
The following example shows the use of the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header. It creates a task, expresses **startDateTime** and **dueDateTime** in Eastern Standard Time (EST), and includes 
a `Prefer` header of Pacific Standard Time (PST).
<!-- {

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/outlook/tasks
Prefer: outlook.timezone="Pacific Standard Time"
Content-type: application/json
Content-length: 276

{
  "assignedTo": "Dana Swope",
  "subject": "Shop for children's weekend",
  "startDateTime": {
      "dateTime": "2016-05-03T09:00:00",
      "timeZone": "Eastern Standard Time"
  },
  "dueDateTime":  {
      "dateTime": "2016-05-05T16:00:00",
      "timeZone": "Eastern Standard Time"
  }
}
```
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [outlookTask](../resources/outlooktask.md) object.
##### Response
The POST method ignores the time portion of **startDateTime** and **dueDateTime** in the request body and assumes the time to be always 
midnight in the specified time zone (EST).

Since the `Prefer` header specifies PST, the POST method expresses all the date-related properties in the response in PST. 
In particular, for the **startDateTime** and **dueDateTime** properties, the POST method converts midnight in EST to PST and returns them in PST in the response.

Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.
