# Update subscription

Renew a subscription by extending its expiry time.

Subscriptions expire after a length of time that varies by resource type. In order to avoid missing notifications, an app should renew its subscriptions well in advance of their expiry date. See [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) for maximum length of a subscription for each resource type.
