Renew a subscription by extending its expiry time.

Subscriptions to resources expire at dates proscribed by the individual resource types.
In order not to miss notifications, subscriptions should be renewed well in advance of their expiry date.
See [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) for individual expiry dates.
