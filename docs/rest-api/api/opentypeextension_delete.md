|**Supported resource**|**Permission**|**Supported resource**|**Permission** |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| [administrativeunit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) | Directory.AccessAsUser.All | [device](../resources/device.md) | Device.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

In the request, identify the resource instance, use the **extensions** 
navigation property of that instance to identify the extension, and do a `DELETE` on that extension instance.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /administrativeUnits/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /devices/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/events/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/events/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/messages/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /organization/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/extensions/{extensionId}
```

>**Note:** The above syntax shows some common ways to identify a resource instance, in order to delete an extension from it. 
All other syntax that allows you to identify these resource instances supports deleting open extensions from them in a similar way.
