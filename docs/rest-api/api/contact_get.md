# Get contact

Retrieve the properties and relationships of a contact object.


### Get contacts in another user's contact folder

If you have application permissions, or if you have the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, it's possible to get contacts 
from another user's contact folder. This section focuses on scenarios that involve delegated permissions.

For example, your app has acquired delegated permissions from the user, John. Suppose another user, Garth, has shared a contact folder with John. 
You can get a contact in that shared folder by specifying Garth’s user ID (or user principal name) in the example query shown below.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users/{Garth-id | Garth-userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}
```

This capability applies to all the supported GET contacts operations for an individual user, as listed in the [HTTP request](#http-request) section below. 
It also applies if Garth has delegated his entire mailbox to John.

If Garth has not shared his contact folder with John, nor has he delegated his mailbox to John, specifying Garth’s user ID or user principal name in those GET operations 
will return an error. In such cases, specifying a user ID or user principal name only works for getting a contact in the signed-in user’s own contact folders, 
and the query is equivalent to using the /me shortcut:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/contacts/{id}
```

This capability is available in only GET operations of:

- Shared contact folders, calendars, and message folders 
- Contacts, events, and messages in shared folders
- The above resources in delegated mailboxes

This capability is not available in other operations for contacts, events, messages, and their folders.


## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Contacts.Read, Contacts.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
A [contact](../resources/contact.md) from a user's default [contactFolder](../resources/contactfolder.md).
```http
GET /me/contacts/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}
```
A [contact](../resources/contact.md) from a user's top level [contactFolder](../resources/contactfolder.md).
```http
GET /me/contactfolders/{Id}/contacts/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactfolders/{id}/contacts/{id}
```
A [contact](../resources/contact.md) contained in a child folder of a [contactFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md). The 
example below shows one level of nesting, but a contact can be located in a child of a child and so on.
```http
GET /me/contactFolder/{id}/childFolders/{id}/.../contacts/{id}
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/contactFolders/{id}/childFolders/{id}/contacts/{id}
```
