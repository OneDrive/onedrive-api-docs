# Get organization

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Retrieve the properties and relationships of currently authenticated organization.

Since the **organization** resource supports [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in an **organization** instance.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | User.Read, Directory.Read.All |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported. |
|Application | Directory.Read.All |

> Note: Applications granted the User.Read permission are able to read only the *id*, *displayName*, and *verifiedDomains* properties of the organization.  All other properties will return with `null` values. To read all properties, use Directory.Read.All.
