## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored"} -->

```http
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
GET /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
```

## Response

Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL for the bytes of the file.

To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow the `Location` header in the response.
Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immedately.

Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.

## Example

This example retrieves a version of a file in the current user's drive.

### HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-version-contents", "scopes": "files.read", "tags": "service.graph" } -->

```http
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/versions/{version-id}/content
```

### Response

This returns a redirect to where the contents of the version can be downloaded.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "isEmpty": true  } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://onedrive.com/34FF49D6...
```


## Remarks

OneDrive does not preserve the complete metadata for previous versions of a file.

When your app retrieves the list of available versions for a file, a [DriveItemVersion](../resources/driveItemVersion.md) resource is returned that provides the available information about the specific version.
