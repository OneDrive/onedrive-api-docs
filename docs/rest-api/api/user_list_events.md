# List events

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Get a list of [event](../resources/event.md) objects from the user's default calendar or 
from a specified calendar. The list contains single instance meetings and series masters.

To get expanded event instances, you can [get the calendar view](calendar_list_calendarview.md), or 
[get the instances of an event](event_list_instances.md).

### Get events in another user's calendar

If you have application permissions, or if you have the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, it's possible to 
get events from another user's calendar. This section focuses on scenarios that involve delegated permissions.

For example, your app has acquired delegated permissions from the user, John. Suppose another user, Garth, has shared a calendar with John. 
You can get the events in that shared calendar by specifying Garth’s user ID (or user principal name) in the example query shown below.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users/{Garth-id | Garth-userPrincipalName}/events
```

This capability applies to all the supported GET events operations for an individual user, as listed in the [HTTP request](#http-request) section below. 
It also applies if Garth has delegated his entire mailbox to John.

If Garth has not shared his calendar with John, nor has he delegated his mailbox to John, specifying Garth’s user ID or user principal name in those GET operations 
will return an error. In such cases, specifying a user ID or user principal name only works for getting events in the signed-in user’s own calendars, 
and the query is equivalent to using the /me shortcut:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/events
```

This capability is available in only GET operations of:

- Shared contact folders, calendars, and message folders 
- Contacts, events, and messages in shared folders
- The above resources in delegated mailboxes

This capability is not available in other operations for contacts, events, messages, and their folders.


### Support various time zones

For all GET operations that return events, you can use the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to specify the time zone for the event start and end times in the response. 

For example, the following `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header sets the start and end times in the response to Eastern Standard Time.
```http
Prefer: outlook.timezone="Eastern Standard Time"
```

If the event was created in a different time zone, the start and end times will be adjusted to the time zone specified in that `Prefer` header. 
See this [list](../resources/datetimetimezone.md) for the supported time zone names. If the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header is not specified, the start and end 
times are returned in UTC.

You can use the **OriginalStartTimeZone** and **OriginalEndTimeZone** properties on the **event** resource to 
find out the time zone used when the event was created.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/events
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/events

GET /me/calendar/events
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/calendar/events

GET /me/calendars/{id}/events

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/overview/query_parameters) to help customize the response.
## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Prefer: outlook.timezone | string | Use this to specify the time zone for start and end times in the response. If not specified, those time values are returned in UTC. Optional. |
| Prefer: outlook.body-content-type | string | The format of the **body** property to be returned in. Values can be "text" or "html". A `Preference-Applied` header is returned as confirmation if this `Prefer` header is specified. If the header is not specified, the **body** property is returned in HTML format. Optional. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [event](../resources/event.md) objects in the response body.
## Example
##### Request 1
The first example gets all the user's events. It specifies the following:

- A `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to get date time values returned in Pacific Standard Time. 
- A `$select` query parameter to return specific properties. Without a `$select` parameter, all of the event properties will be returned.

The request does not specify any `Prefer: outlook.body-content-type` header to indicate a specific format for the returned event body.

```
##### Response 1
Here is an example of the response. Because no `Prefer: outlook.body-content-type` header was specified, the **body** property is returned in the default HTML format.

##### Request 2
The second example shows how to use a `Prefer: outlook.body-content-type="text"` header to get the **body** property of the specified message in text format.

The request also uses a `$select` query parameter to return specific properties. Without a `$select` parameter, all of the event properties will be returned.
