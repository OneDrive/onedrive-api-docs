# Start sync after uploading files to an educationSynchronizationProfile

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Verify the files uploaded to a specific school data [synchronization profile](../resources/educationsynchronizationprofile.md) in the tenant. If the verification is successful, synchronization will start on the profile. Otherwise, the response will contain errors and warnings. If the response contains errors, the synchronization will not start. If the response contains only warnings, synchronization will start.

> **Note:** Use this method only when the data provider is of type [educationcsvdataprovider](../resources/educationcsvdataprovider.md). Also, the profile's state property needs to be provisioned before it can be started. Poll the profile object to check its state property.
