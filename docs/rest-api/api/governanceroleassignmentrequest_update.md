# Update governanceRoleAssignmentRequests

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Enable administrators to update their decisions (`AdminApproved` or `AdminDenied`) on [governanceRoleAssignmentRequests](../resources/governanceroleassignmentrequest.md) that are in status of `PendingAdminDecision`.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureResources  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | PrivilegedAccess.ReadWrite.AzureResources |

Besides the permission scope, this API requires the requestor to have at least one `Active` adminstrator role assignment (`owner` or `user access administrator`) on the resource, which the [governanceRoleAssignmentRequest](../resources/governanceroleassignmentrequest.md) belongs to.
