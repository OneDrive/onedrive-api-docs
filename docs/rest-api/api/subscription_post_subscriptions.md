## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /subscriptions
```

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and a [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) object in the response body.

## Example

### Request

Here is an example of the request to send a notification when the contents of a user's drive changes.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "add-subscription-graph", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.subscription", "tags": "service.graph" } -->

```http
POST /subscriptions
Content-type: application/json

{
 "changeType": "updated",
 "notificationUrl": "https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/api/webhook-receiver",
 "resource": "/me/drive/root",
 "expirationDateTime": "2018-01-01T11:23:00.000Z",
 "clientState": "client-specific string"
}
```

## Response

If the subscription is added, then a `201 Created` response is returned that
includes the newly created subscription object.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.subscription" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "1039149811asbc",
    "resource": "/me/drive/root",
    "changeType": "updated",
    "clientState": "client-specific string",
    "notificationUrl": "https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/api/webhook-receiver",
    "expirationDateTime": "2016-01-01T11:23:00.000Z"
}
```

## Subscription validation

Before a new subscription is created, Microsoft Graph will send a request to the URL provided in the request to create a new subscription.
Your service must respond to this request by returning the validation key.

If your service fails to validate the request in this way, the subscription will fail to be created.

See [handling webhook validation requests](../concepts/webhook-receiver-validation-request.md) for detailed information.

## Error responses

See [Error Responses][error-response] for more info about
how errors are returned.
