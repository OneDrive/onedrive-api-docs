# Create a sharing link for a DriveItem

You can use **createLink** action to share a [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) via a sharing link.

The **createLink** action will create a new sharing link if the specified link type doesn't already exist for the calling application.
If a sharing link of the specified type already exists for the app, the existing sharing link will be returned.

DriveItem resources inherit sharing permissions from their ancestors.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## Response

The response will be `201 Created` if a new sharing link is created for the item or `200 OK` if an existing link is returned.

## Example

The following example requests a sharing link to be created for the DriveItem specified by {itemId} in the user's OneDrive.
The sharing link is configured to be read-only and usable by anyone with the link.

## Creating embeddable links

When using the `embed` link type, the webUrl returned can be embedded in an `<iframe>` HTML element.

**Note:** Embed links are only supported for OneDrive personal.
