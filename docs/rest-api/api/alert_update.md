# Update alert

 > **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
PATCH /security/alerts/{id}
```

## Request headers

| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {code}. Required.|
|Prefer | return=representation |

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the values for relevant fields that should be updated. The following table lists the fields that can be updated for an alert. The values for existing properties that are not included in the request body will not change. For best performance, don't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property   | Type |Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|assignedTo|String|Name of the analyst the alert is assigned to for triage, investigation, or remediation.|
|closedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|Time at which the alert was closed. The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'`.|
|comments|String|Analyst comments on the alert (for customer alert management).|
|feedback|string|Analyst feedback on the alert. Possible values are: `unknown`, `truePositive`, `falsePositive`, `benignPositive`.|
|status|string|Alert lifecycle status (stage). Possible values are: `unknown`, `newAlert`, `inProgress`, `resolved`.|
|tags|String|User-definable labels that can be applied to an alert and can serve as filter conditions (for example, "HVA", "SAW).|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `204 No Content` response code.

If the optional request header is used, the method returns a `200 OK` response code and the updated [alert](../resources/alert.md) object in the response body.
