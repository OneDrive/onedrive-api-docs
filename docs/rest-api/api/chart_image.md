## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /workbook/worksheets/{id|name}/charts(<name>)/Image(width=0,height=0,fittingMode='fit')

```
## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Workbook-Session-Id  | Workbook session Id that determines if changes are persisted or not. Optional.|

|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|height|number|Optional. The desired height of the resulting image.|
|width|number|Optional. The desired width of the resulting image.|
|fittingMode|string|Optional. The method used to scale the chart to the specified to the specified dimensions (if both height and width are set)."  Possible values are: `Fit`, `FitAndCenter`, `Fill`.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns `200 OK` response code and base-64 image string in the response body.

## Example
Here is an example of how to call this API.
##### Request
Here is an example of the request.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{id}/workbook/worksheets/{id|name}/charts(<name>)/Image(width=0,height=0,fittingMode='fit')
```

##### Response
Here is an example of the response. Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json
Content-length: 3

{
"value" : "base-64 chart image string"
}
```

##### Usage

You can display the base-64 string inside an HTML image tag: `<img src="data:image/png;base64,{base-64 chart image string}/>`.

For default behavior, use `Image(width=0,height=0,fittingMode='fit')`. Here is an example of a chart image returned with the default parameters.

If you want to customize the display of the image, specify a height, width, and a fitting mode. Here is what the same chart image looks like if you retrieve it with these parameters: `Image(width=500,height=500,fittingMode='Fill')`.
