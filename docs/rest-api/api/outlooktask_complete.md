# outlookTask: complete

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Complete an Outlook task which sets the **completedDateTime** property to the current date, 
and the **status** property to `completed`.

If you are completing a task in a recurring series, in the response, the task collection will contain the 
completed task in the series, and the next task in the series.

The **completedDateTime** property represents the date when the task is finished. The time portion 
of **completedDateTime** is set to midnight UTC by default. 

By default, this operation (and the POST, GET, and PATCH task operations) returns date-related properties in UTC. 
You can use the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to have all the date-related properties in the response represented in a time zone 
different than UTC.
