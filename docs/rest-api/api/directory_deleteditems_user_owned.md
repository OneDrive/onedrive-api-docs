# **List deleted items owned by a user**

Retrieves a list of recently deleted items owned by the specified user.  

Currently, list deleted items functionality is supported only for [group](../resources/group.md) resources owned by the user.

This is a service action, which means it does not support pagination.  The API returns up to 1,000 deleted objects owned by the user, sorted by ID.  Should the user own 1,000 or more deleted objects, the API returns nothing.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn
more, including how to choose permissions, see
[Permissions](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference).

| Permission type | Permissions (from least to most privileged) |
| --- | --- |
| Delegated (work or school account) | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) |  Not supported. |
| Application | Group.Read.All, Group.ReadWrite.All  |
