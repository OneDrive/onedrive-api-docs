# Upload a custom thumbnail for a DriveItem



This request allows your app to upload a custom thumbnail, which persists with the file
even if the file's contents is updated, to any item that has the `file` facet.   If a
custom uploaded thumbnail is already set, then this request will overwrite that existing
custom uploaded thumbnail.

**Note:** Custom thumbnails are only available on OneDrive Personal.

### HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "add-custom-thumbnail", "scopes": "files.readwrite", "tags": "service.onedrive" } -->
```
PUT /drive/items/{item-id}/thumbnails/0/source/content
Content-Type: application/octet-stream

<<The contents of the image goes here.>>
```

### Response

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "isEmpty": true } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

If successful, this call returns a `200 OK` response to indicate that custom thumbnail was
upload successfully. In the response, the `Content-Location` and the `Location` response
header will return the URL to that custom thumbnail.


## Determine if a custom uploaded thumbnail exists

To determine if a custom uploaded thumbnail exists on a file, look for the `source` property
on the thumbnail set. If it has a value, then the value represents the custom uploaded
thumbnail. If it is not present, then no custom uploaded thumbnail exists.

**Note:** Custom thumbnails are only available on OneDrive Personal.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-custom-thumbnail", "scopes": "files.read", "tags": "service.onedrive service.graph" } -->
```
GET /drive/items/{item-id}/?expand=thumbnails(select=id,large,medium,small,source)
```
