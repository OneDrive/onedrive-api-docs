# Create inferenceClassificationOverride

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Create a [Focused Inbox](../resources/manage_focused_inbox.md) override for a sender identified by an SMTP address. Future messages from that SMTP address will be consistently classified 
as specified in the override.

**Note**

- If an override already exists with the same STMP address, then the **classifyAs** and **name** fields of that override are updated with the provided values.
- The maximum number of overrides supported for a mailbox is 1000, based on unique sender SMTP addresses.
- The POST operation supports creating only one override at a time.
