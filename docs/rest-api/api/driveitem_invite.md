# Send a sharing invitation

Sends a sharing invitation for a **DriveItem**.
A sharing invitation provides permissions to the recipients and optionally sends them an email with a [sharing link][].

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

| Permission type                   | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
POST /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/invite
POST /drive/items/{item-id}/invite
POST /sites/{siteId}/drive/items/{itemId}/invite
```

## Request body

In the request body, provide a JSON object with the following parameters.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "scopes": "files.readwrite" } -->

```json
{
  "requireSignIn": false,
  "sendInvitation": false,
  "roles": [ "read | write"],
  "recipients": [
    { "@odata.type": "oneDrive.driveRecipient" },
    { "@odata.type": "oneDrive.driveRecipient" }
  ],
  "message": "string"
}
```

| Parameter        | Type                           | Description
|:-----------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------------------
| recipients       | Collection([DriveRecipient][]) | A collection of recipients who will receive access and the sharing invitation.
| message          | String                         | A plain text formatted message that is included in the sharing invitation. Maximum length 2000 characters.

The invitation grants Ryan read-write access to the file.
