# Update educationsubmission

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Add a grade and feedback to a submission. Only teachers can perform this operation. Note that the Basic permission does not have access to the grade properties, and therefore cannot write to grade or feedback. This action does not release the grade and feedback to the student. A teacher must take an explicit release action for the grade data to be returned to the student.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) |  EduAssignments.ReadWrite  |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.   |
|Application | Not supported. |
