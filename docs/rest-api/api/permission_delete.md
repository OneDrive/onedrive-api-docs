# Delete a sharing permission from a file or folder

Remove access to a [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

Only sharing permissions that are **not** inherited can be deleted.
The **inheritedFrom** property must be `null`.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
DELETE /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
DELETE /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
DELETE /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
DELETE /sites/{site-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
DELETE /users/{user-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}

If successful, this method returns `204 No Content` response code.

## Example

This example removes the permission identified as {perm-id} from the item {item-id} in the current user's OneDrive.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "delete-permission", "scopes": "files.readwrite", "tags": "service.graph" }-->

```http
DELETE /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```

## Remarks

* [Drives](../resources/drive.md) with a **driveType** of `personal` (OneDrive Personal) cannot create or modify permissions on the root DriveItem.
