# Create schemaExtension

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Create a new [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) definition to extend a [supporting resource type](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md#supported-resources).

Schema extensions let you add strongly-typed custom data to a resource. The app that creates a schema extension is the owner app. Depending on the 
[state](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md#schema-extensions-lifecycle) of the extension, the owner app, and only the owner app, may update or delete the extension. 

See examples of how to [define a schema extension that describes a training course](../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#2-register-a-schema-extension-definition-that-describes-a-training-course), 
use the schema extension definition to [create a new group with training course data](../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#3-create-a-new-group-with-extended-data), and 
[add training course data to an existing group](../concepts/extensibility_schema_groups.md#4-add-update-or-remove-custom-data-in-an-existing-group).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /schemaExtensions
```

## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | application/json  |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object.

The following table shows the properties that are available when you create a schema extension.

| Parameter | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|description|String|Description for the schema extension.|
|id|String|The unique identifier for the schema extension definition. <br>You can assign a value in one of two ways: <ul><li>Concatenate the name of one of your verified domains with a name for the schema extension to form a unique string in this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}. As an example, `contoso_mySchema`. NOTE: Only verified domains under the following top-level domains are supported: `.com`,`.net`, `.gov`, `.edu` or `.org`. </li><li>Provide a schema name, and let Microsoft Graph use that schema name to complete the **id** assignment in this format: ext\{_&#65279;8-random-alphanumeric-chars_\}\_\{_&#65279;schema-name_\}. An example would be `extkvbmkofy_mySchema`.</li></ul>This property cannot be changed after creation. |
|owner|String|(Optional) The `appId` of the application that is the owner of the schema extension. This property can be supplied on creation, to set the owner.  If not supplied, then the calling application's `appId` will be set as the owner. So, for example, if creating a new schema extension definition using Graph Explorer, you **must** supply the owner property. Once set, this property is read-only and cannot be changed.|
|properties|[extensionSchemaProperty](../resources/extensionschemaproperty.md) collection|The collection of property names and types that make up the schema extension definition.|
|targetTypes|String collection|Set of Microsoft Graph resource types (that support schema extensions) that this schema extension definition can be applied to.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object in the response body.

## Example

##### Request 1

The first example shows using a verified domain name, `graphlearn`, and a schema name, `courses`, to form a unique string for the **id** property of the 
schema extension definition. The unique string is based on this format, \{_&#65279;domainName_\}\_\{_&#65279;schemaName_\}.

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object.

    "id":"graphlearn_courses",

        },
        {
            "name": "courseName",
            "type": "String"
        },
        {
            "name": "courseType",
            "type": "String"
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Response 1

Here is an example of the response. Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.

            "name": "courseType",
            "type": "String"
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Request 2

The second example shows specifying just a schema name, `courses`, in the **id** property in the request, together with the JSON representation of the rest of the 
properties in the [schemaExtension](../resources/schemaextension.md) object. Microsoft Graph will assign and return a unique string value in the response.

        {
            "name": "courseType",
            "type": "String"
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Response 2

The response includes a unique string in the **id** property that is based on the schema name provided in the request, together with the rest of the newly created schema definition. 
The value in **id** in the response is based on the format, ext\{_&#65279;8-random-alphanumeric-chars_\}\_\{_&#65279;schema-name_\}. 
Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.
