# Create group

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Use this API to create a new [group](../resources/group.md) as specified in the request body. You can create one of three types of groups:

* Office 365 Group (unified group)
* Dynamic group
* Security group

> **Note**: To create a [team](../resources/team.md), first create a group then add a team to it, see [create team](../api/team_put_teams.md).

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Group.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Group.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /groups
```

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
The following table shows the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource that you must specify at a minimum when you create a group. 

| Property | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| displayName | string | The name to display in the address book for the group. |
| mailEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for mail-enabled groups. Set this to **true** if creating an Office 365 Group. Set this to **false** if creating dynamic or security group.|
| mailNickname | string | The mail alias for the group. |
| securityEnabled | boolean | Set to **true** for security-enabled groups. Set this to **true** if creating a dynamic or security group. Set this to **false** if creating an Office 365 Group. |

Specify the **groupTypes** property if you're creating an Office 365 or dynamic group, as stated below.

| Type of group | **groupTypes** property |
|:--------------|:------------------------|
| Office 365 (aka unified group)| "Unified" |
| Dynamic | "DynamicMembership" |
| Security | Do not set. |

Since the **group** resource supports [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the group while creating it.

Specify other writable properties as necessary for your group. For more information, see the properties of the [group](../resources/group.md) resource.

## Response
If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [group](../resources/group.md) object in the response body.
