# List resources

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

List the resources associated with this submission. The **submissionResource** object is a wrapper around the actual resource object the student is working on. The wrapper also includes a pointer to the resources on the assignment if this was copied from the assignment during the assign process. These resources are the working copy of the assignment. The **submittedResources** are the resources that have officially been submitted to be graded.
