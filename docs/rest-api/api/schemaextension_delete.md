# Delete schemaExtension

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Delete the definition of a [schema extension](../resources/schemaExtension.md).

Only the app that created the schema extension (owner app) can delete the schema extension definition, 
and only when the extension is in the **InDevelopment** state. Deleting a schema extension definition does not affect 
accessing custom data that has been added to resource instances based on that definition.
