# Get device

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Get the properties and relationships of a device object.

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can also use the `GET` operation to get custom properties and extension data in a **device** instance.
