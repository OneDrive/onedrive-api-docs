# Update outlooktask

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Change writable properties of an Outlook task.

The **completedDateTime** property can be set by the **complete** action, or explicitly by a PATCH operation. 
If you use PATCH to set **completedDateTime**, make sure you set **status** to `completed` as well.

By default, this operation (and the POST, GET, and [complete](../api/outlooktask_complete.md) task operations) returns date-related properties in UTC. 
You can use the `Prefer: outlook.timezone` header to have all the date-related properties in the response represented in a time zone 
different than UTC.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Tasks.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Tasks.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Not supported. |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/outlook/tasks/{id}
PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/outlook/taskFolders/{id}/tasks/{id}
PATCH /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/outlook/taskGroups/{id}/taskFolders/{id}/tasks/{id}

## Optional request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:-----------|:-----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Prefer: outlook.timezone | Specifies the time zone for time properties in the response, which would be in UTC if this header is not specified. Optional.|

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will 
maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

|assignedTo|String|The name of the person who has been assigned the task.|
|body|[itemBody](../resources/itembody.md)|The task body that typically contains information about the task. Note that only HTML type is supported.|

|changeKey|String|The version of the task.|
|completedDateTime|[dateTimeTimeZone](../resources/datetimetimezone.md)|The date in the specified time zone that the task was finished.|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The date and time when the task was created. By default, it is in UTC. You can provide a custom time zone in the request header. The property value uses ISO 8601 format. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'`.|

The property value uses ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'`.|
|owner|String|The name of the person who created the task.|
|parentFolderId|String|The unique identifier for the task's parent folder.|
