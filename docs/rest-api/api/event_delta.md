# event: delta

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Get a set of events that have been added, deleted, or updated in a **calendarView** (a range of events) 
of the user's primary calendar.

A **delta** function call for events is similar to a `GET /calendarview` request for 
a range of dates in the user's primary calendar, except that by appropriately 
applying [state tokens](../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) in one or more of these calls, 
you can query for incremental changes in that calender view. This allows you to maintain and synchronize 
a local store of a user's events in the primary calendar, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar 
from the server every time.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Calendars.Read, Calendars.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/calendarView/delta?startDateTime={start_datetime}&endDateTime={end_datetime}
GET /users/<id>/calendarView/delta?startDateTime={start_datetime}&endDateTime={end_datetime}

```

### Query parameters

Tracking changes in events incurs a round of one or more **delta** function calls. If you use any query parameter 
(other than `$deltatoken` and `$skiptoken`), you must specify 
it in the initial **delta** request. Microsoft Graph automatically encodes any specified parameters 
into the token portion of the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL provided in the response. You only need to specify any desired query parameters once upfront. 
In subsequent requests, simply copy and apply the `nextLink` or `deltaLink` URL from the previous response, as that URL already 
includes the encoded, desired parameters.


| Query parameter	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|startDateTime|String|The start date and time of the time range, represented in ISO 8601 format. For example, "2015-11-08T19:00:00.0000000".|
|endDateTime|String|The end date and time of the time range, represented in ISO 8601 format. For example, "2015-11-08T20:00:00.0000000".|
| $deltatoken | string | A [state token](../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) returned in the `deltaLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call for the same calendar view, indicating the completion of that round of change tracking. Save and apply the entire `deltaLink` URL including this token in the first request of the next round of change tracking for that calendar view.|
| $skiptoken | string | A [state token](../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) returned in the `nextLink` URL of the previous **delta** function call, indicating there are further changes to be tracked in the same calendar view. |

When you do a delta query on a calendar view, expect to get all the properties you'd normally get from 
a `GET /calendarview` request. `$select` is not supported in this case. 


## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description |
|:---------------|:----------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type  | string  | application/json. Required. |
| Prefer | string  | odata.maxpagesize={x}. Optional. |
| Prefer | string | {Time zone}. Optional, UTC assumed if absent.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and [event](../resources/event.md) collection object in the response body.

## Example
##### Request

The following example shows how to make a single **delta** function call, and limit the maximum number of events 
in the response body to 2.

To track changes in a calendar view, you would make one or more **delta** function calls, with 
appropriate [state tokens](../concepts/delta_query_overview.md), to get the set of incremental changes since the last delta query. 

<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "event_delta"
}-->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/calendarview/delta?startdatetime={start_datetime}&enddatetime={end_datetime}

Prefer: odata.maxpagesize=2
```

##### Response
If the request is successful, the response would include a state token, which is either a _skipToken_ 
(in an _@odata.nextLink_ response header) or a _deltaToken_ (in an _@odata.deltaLink_ response header). 
Respectively, they indicate whether you should continue with the round or you have completed 
getting all the changes for that round.

The response below shows a _skipToken_ in an _@odata.nextLink_ response header.

Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.
