# Get a site resource by path

Retrieve properties and relationships for a [site][] resource.
A **site** resource represents a team site in SharePoint.

[site]: ../resources/site.md

In addition to retrieving a [site by ID](site_get.md) you can retrieve a site based on server-relative URL path.

* Site collection hostname (contoso.sharepoint.com)
* Site path, relative to server hostname.

There is also a reserved site identifier, `root`, which always references the root site for a given target, as follows:

* `/sites/root`: The tenant root site.
* `/groups/{group-id}/sites/root`: The group's team site.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |

|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Sites.Read.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |
