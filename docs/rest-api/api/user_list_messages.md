# List messages

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Get the messages in the signed-in user's mailbox (including the Deleted Items and Clutter folders). 

In particular, you can filter on the messages and get only those that include a [mention](../resources/mention.md) of the signed-in user.

Note that by default, the `GET /me/messages` operation does not return the **mentions** property. Use the `$expand` query parameter 
to [find details of each mention in a message](../api/message_get.md#request-2).


### Get messages in another user's message folder

If you have application permissions, or if you have the appropriate delegated [permissions](#permissions) from one user, it's possible to get messages 
from another user's message folder. This section focuses on scenarios that involve delegated permissions.

For example, your app has acquired delegated permissions from the user, John. Suppose another user, Garth, has shared a message folder with John. 
You can get the messages in that shared folder by specifying Garth’s user ID (or user principal name) in the example query shown below.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /users/{Garth-id | Garth-userPrincipalName}/messages
```

This capability applies to all the supported GET messages operations for an individual user, as listed in the [HTTP request](#http-request) section below. 
It also applies if Garth has delegated his entire mailbox to John.

If Garth has not shared his message folder with John, nor has he delegated his mailbox to John, specifying Garth’s user ID or user principal name in those GET operations 
will return an error. In such cases, specifying a user ID or user principal name only works for getting messages in the signed-in user’s own message folders, 
and the query is equivalent to using the /me shortcut:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/messages
```

This capability is available in only GET operations of:

- Shared contact folders, calendars, and message folders 
- Contacts, events, and messages in shared folders
- The above resources in delegated mailboxes

This capability is not available in other operations for contacts, events, messages, and their folders.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite    |
|Application | Mail.Read, Mail.ReadWrite |

## HTTP request

To get all the messages in a user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages
```

To get messages in a specific folder in the user's mailbox:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/mailFolders/{id}/messages
```

To get all the messages in the user's mailbox that include a **mention** of the user:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/messages?$filter=mentionsPreview/isMentioned eq true
GET /users/{id | userPrincipalName}/messages?$filter=mentionsPreview/isMentioned eq true
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/overview/query_parameters) to help customize the response.

You can use the `$filter` query parameter on the **mentionsPreview** property to get those messages that mention
the signed-in user.

## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Prefer: outlook.body-content-type | string | The format of the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties to be returned in. Values can be "text" or "html". If the header is not specified, the **body** and **uniqueBody** properties are returned in HTML format. Optional. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [message](../resources/message.md) objects in the response body.

The default page size for this request is 10 messages. 

## Example
##### Request 1
The first example gets the top 10 messages in the signed-in user's mailbox.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_messages"
}-->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages
```
##### Response 1
Here is an example of the response. Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",
  "truncated": true,
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.message",
  "isCollection": true
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{
  "value": [

      "bodyPreview": "bodyPreview-value"
    }
  ]
}
```


##### Request 2
The next example filters all messages in the signed-in user's mailbox for those that mention the user. It uses `$select` 
to return a subset of the properties of each message in the response. 

The example also incorporates URL encoding for the space characters in the query parameter string.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_messages_with_mentions"
}-->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/messages?$filter=MentionsPreview/IsMentioned%20eq%20true&$select=Subject,Sender,ReceivedDateTime,MentionsPreview
```
