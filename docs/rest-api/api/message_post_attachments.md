# Add attachment

Use this API to add an [attachment](../resources/attachment.md) to a message. 

An attachment can be one of the following types:

* A file ([fileAttachment](../resources/fileattachment.md) resource).
* An item (contact, event or message, represented by an [itemAttachment](../resources/itemattachment.md) resource).
* A link to a file ([referenceAttachment](../resources/referenceAttachment.md) resource).

All these types of attachment resources are derived from the [attachment](../resources/attachment.md)
resource. 

You can add an attachment to an existing message by posting to its attachments collection, or you can 
add an attachment to a message that is being [created and sent on the fly](../api/user_sendmail.md).

Since there is currently a limit of 4MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the 
size of the attachment you can add to under 4MB.
