## HTTP request

GET /me/insights/shared
```
Request with a 'user id' or 'userPrincipalName' is only accessible by the user, not by anyone else:
```http
GET /users/<id | userPrincipalName>/insights/shared
```

## Optional query parameters
This method supports the [OData Query Parameters](http://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/overview/query_parameters) to help customize the response.

You can use the `$filter` query parameter to filter shared items. For example, based on Type:

`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/insights/shared?$filter=ResourceVisualization/Type eq 'PowerPoint'`

See the available Container Types and Types you can filter by in [resourceVisualization](../resources/insights_resourceVisualization.md).

You can also retrieve files shared by a specific user. For example, by specifying the `lastshared/sharedby/address` property:

`https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/insights/shared?$filter=lastshared/sharedby/address eq 'kellygraham@contoso.com'`

See the [sharingDetail](../resources/insights_sharingdetail.md) complex type.
