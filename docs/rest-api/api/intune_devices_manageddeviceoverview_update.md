# Update managedDeviceOverview

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) by the customer.

Update the properties of a [managedDeviceOverview](../resources/intune_devices_manageddeviceoverview.md) object.
