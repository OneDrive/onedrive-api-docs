# Unarchive team

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Restore an archived [team](../resources/team.md). This restores users' ability to send messages and edit the team, abiding by tenant and team settings. Teams are archived using the [archive](team_archive.md) API.

Unarchiving is an async operation. A team is unarchived once the async operation completes successfully, which may occur subsequent to a response from this API.

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

## Response

If unarchiving is started successfully, this method returns a `202 Accepted` response code. The response will also contain a `Location` header, which contains the location of the [teamsAsyncOperation](../resources/teamsasyncoperation.md) that was created to handle unarchiving of the team.
