# Create multi-value extended property

Create one or more multi-value extended properties in a new or existing instance of a resource. 

The following user resources are supported:

- [message](../resources/message.md)
- [mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md)
- [event](../resources/event.md)
- [calendar](../resources/calendar.md)
- [contact](../resources/contact.md)
- [contactFolder](../resources/contactfolder.md) 

As well as the following group resources:

- group [event](../resources/event.md)
- group [calendar](../resources/calendar.md)
- group [post](../resources/post.md) 

See [Extended properties overview](../resources/extended-properties-overview.md) for more information about when to use 
open extensions or extended properties, and how to specify extended properties.

## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API, depending on the resource you're
creating the extended property in. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

- Mail.ReadWrite
- Calendars.ReadWrite
- Contacts.ReadWrite
- Group.ReadWrite.All
 
## HTTP request
You can create extended properties in a new or existing resource instance.

To create one or more extended properties in a _new_ resource instance, use the same REST request as creating the
instance, and include the properties of the new resource instance _and extended property_ in the request body.
Note that some resources support creation in more than one way. For more information on creating these resource instances,
see the corresponding topics for creating a [message](../resources/message.md), [mailFolder](../api/user_post_mailfolders.md),
[event](../api/user_post_events.md), [calendar](../api/user_post_calendars.md),
[contact](../api/user_post_contacts.md), [contactFolder](../api/user_post_contactfolders.md),
[group event](../api/group_post_events.md), and [group post](../resources/post.md). 
 
The following is the syntax of the requests. 

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /me/messages
POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/messages
POST /me/mailFolders/{id}/messages

POST /me/mailFolders
POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/mailFolders

POST /me/events
POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/events

POST /me/calendars
POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/calendars

POST /me/contacts
POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contacts

POST /me/contactFolders
POST /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contactFolders

POST /groups/{id}/events

POST /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/reply
POST /groups/{id}/conversations/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/reply
POST /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/reply
POST /groups/{id}/conversations/{id}/threads/{id}/reply
POST /groups/{id}/threads
POST /groups/{id}/conversations
```

To create one or more extended properties in an existing resource instance, specify the instance in the
request, and include the extended property in the request body.

**Note** You cannot create an extended property in an existing group post.

## Path parameters
|Parameter|Type|Description|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|id|string|A unique identifier for an object in the corresponding collection. Required.|

## Request body parameters
|multiValueExtendedProperties|[multiValueLegacyExtendedProperty](../resources/multiValueLegacyExtendedProperty.md) collection| An array of one or more multi-valued extended properties. |
|id|String|For each property in the **multiValueExtendedProperties** collection, specify this to identify the property. It must follow one of the supported formats. See [Outlook extended properties overview](../resources/extended-properties-overview.md) for more information. Required.|
|value|string|For each property in the **multiValueExtendedProperties** collection, specify the property value. Required.|

## Request headers
| Name       | Value |
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required. |
| Content-Type | application/json |

## Request body

Provide a JSON body of each [multiValueLegacyExtendedProperty](../resources/multiValueLegacyExtendedProperty.md) object in the 
**multiValueExtendedProperties** collection property of the resource instance.

When creating an extended property in a _new_ resource instance, in addition to the 
new **multiValueExtendedProperties** collection, provide a JSON representation of that resource instance (that is, a [message](../resources/message.md), 
[mailFolder](../resources/mailfolder.md), [event](../resources/event.md), etc.)

## Response

#### Response code
An operation successful in creating an extended property in a new resource instance returns `201 Created`, except in a new group post, 
depending on the method used, the operation can return `200 OK` or `202 Accepted`.

In an existing resource instance, a successful create operation returns `200 OK`. 


#### Response body

When creating an extended property in a supported resource other than [group post](../resources/post.md), the response includes only 
the new or existing instance but not the new extended property. To see the newly
created extended property, [get the instance expanded with the extended property](../api/multivaluelegacyextendedproperty_get.md).

When creating an extended property in a _new_ group post, the response includes only a response code but not the new post nor 
the extended property. You cannot create an extended property in an existing group post.


## Example
##### Request 1

The first example creates a multi-value extended property in a new event all in the same POST operation. Apart from the properties you'd normally 
include for a new event, the request body includes the **multiValueExtendedProperties** collection which contains one extended property. 
The request body includes the following for that multi-value extended property:

- **id** which specifies the property as an array of strings with the specified GUID and the name `Recreation`. 
- **value** which specifies `Recreation` as an array of 3 string values, `["Food", "Hiking", "Swimming"]`.

           "id":"StringArray {66f5a359-4659-4830-9070-00050ec6ac6e} Name Recreation",
           "value": ["Food", "Hiking", "Swimming"]
     }
  ]
}
```

##### Response 1

A successful response is indicated by an `HTTP 201 Created` response code, and includes the new event 
in the response body, similar to the response from [creating just an event](../api/user_post_events.md). 
The response does not include any newly created extended properties.

To see the newly created extended property, [get the event expanded with the extended property](../api/multivaluelegacyextendedproperty_get.md).


****

##### Request 2

The second example creates one multi-value extended property for the specified message. That extended property is the only
element in the **multiValueExtendedProperties** collection. The request body includes the following for the 
extended property:

- **id** specifies the property as an array of strings with the specified GUID and the name `Palette`.
- **value** specifies `Palette` as an array of 3 string values, `["Green", "Aqua", "Blue"]`.

```http
PATCH https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages('AAMkAGE1M2_as77AACHsLrBBBA=')

Content-Type: application/json

{
  "multiValueExtendedProperties": [
      {
         "id":"StringArray {66f5a359-4659-4830-9070-00049ec6ac6e} Name Palette",
         "value":["Green", "Aqua", "Blue"]
      }
    ]
}
```

##### Response 2

A successful response is indicated by an `HTTP 200 OK` response code, and includes the specified message in the response body, 
similar to the response from [updating a message](../api/message_update.md). The response does not 
include the newly created extended property.

To see the newly created extended property, [get the message expanded with the extended property](../api/multivaluelegacyextendedproperty_get.md).
