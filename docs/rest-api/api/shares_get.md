# Accessing shared DriveItems

Access a shared [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) or a collection of shared items by using a **shareId** or sharing URL.

To use a sharing URL with this API, your app needs to [transform the URL into a sharing token](#encoding-sharing-urls).

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Files.ReadWrite, Files.ReadWrite.All    |
|Application | Files.ReadWrite.All, Sites.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->

```http
GET /shares/{shareIdOrEncodedSharingUrl}
```

### Path Parameters

| Parameter Name        | Value    | Description                                                                         |
|:----------------------|:---------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **sharingTokenOrUrl** | `string` | Required. A sharing token as returned by the API or a properly encoded sharing URL. |

### Encoding sharing URLs

To encode a sharing URL, use the following logic:

1. First, use base64 encode the URL.
2. Convert the base64 encoded result to [unpadded base64url format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) by removing `=` characters
   from the end of the value, replacing `/` with `_` and `+` with `-`.)
3. Append `u!` to be beginning of the string.

As an example, to encode a URL in C#:

```csharp
string sharingUrl = "https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=1231244193912!12&authKey=1201919!12921!1";
string base64Value = System.Convert.ToBase64String(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(sharingUrl));
string encodedUrl = "u!" + base64Value.TrimEnd('=').Replace('/','_').Replace('+','-');
```

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [sharedDriveItem](../resources/shareddriveitem.md) resource in the response body.

## Example

### Request

Here is an example of the request to retrieve a shared item:

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-shared-root" } -->

```http
GET /shares/{shareIdOrEncodedSharingUrl}
```

### Response

Here is an example of the response.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "truncated": true, "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.sharedDriveItem" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-type: application/json

{
  "id": "B64397C8-07AE-43E4-920E-32BFB4331A5B",
  "name": "contoso project.docx",
  "owner": {
    "user": {
      "id": "98E88F1C-F8DC-47CC-A406-C090248B30E5",
      "displayName": "Ryan Gregg"
    }
  }
}
```

## Access the shared item directly

While the [**SharedDriveItem**](../resources/shareddriveitem.md) contains some useful information, most apps will want to directly access the shared [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).
The **SharedDriveItem** resource includes a **root** and **items** relationships which can access content within the scope of the shared item.

## Example (single file)

### Request

By requesting the **driveItem** relationship, the **DriveItem** that was shared will be returned.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-shared-driveitem" } -->

```http
GET /shares/{shareIdOrUrl}/driveItem
```

### Response

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "truncated": true, "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "9FFFDB3C-5B87-4062-9606-1B008CA88E44",
  "name": "contoso project.docx",
  "eTag": "2246BD2D-7811-4660-BD0F-1CF36133677B,1",
  "file": {},
  "size": 109112
}
```

## Example (shared folder)

### Request

By requesting the **driveItem** relationship and expanding the **children** collection, the **DriveItem** that was shared will be returned along with the files within the shared folder.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "get-shared-driveitem-expand-children" } -->

```http
GET /shares/{shareIdOrUrl}/driveItem?$expand=children
```

### Response

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "truncated": true, "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.driveItem" } -->

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": "9FFFDB3C-5B87-4062-9606-1B008CA88E44",
  "name": "Contoso Project",
  "eTag": "2246BD2D-7811-4660-BD0F-1CF36133677B,1",
  "folder": {},
  "size": 10911212,
  "children": [
    {
      "id": "AFBBDD79-868E-452D-AD4D-24697D4A4044",
      "name": "Propsoal.docx",
      "file": {},
      "size": 19001
    },
    {
      "id": "A91FE90A-2F2C-4EE6-B412-C4FFBA3F71A6",
      "name": "Update to Proposal.docx",
      "file": {},
      "size": 91001
    }
  ]
}
```

## Error Responses

Read the [Error Responses][error-response] topic for more information about
how errors are returned.

## Remarks

* For OneDrive for Business and SharePoint, the Shares API always requires authentication and cannot be used to access anonymously shared content without a user context.
