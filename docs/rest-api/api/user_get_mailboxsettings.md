# Get user mailbox settings

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Get the user's [mailboxSettings](../resources/mailboxsettings.md). This includes settings for automatic replies (notify people automatically upon 
receipt of their email), locale (language and country/region), time zone, and working hours.

You can view all mailbox settings, or, get specific settings.

Time zone is one of the preferred settings a user can set up for the user's mailbox. The user chooses it from the [supported time zones](outlookuser_supportedtimezones.md) that an administrator has set up for the user's mailbox server. The administrator sets up time zones in the Windows time zone format or  [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) time zone](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) (also known as Olson time zone) format. The Windows format is the default. 

When you get a user's preferred time zone, the time zone is returned in the format that it was set up. If you want that time zone to be in a specific format (Windows or IANA), you can first [update the preferred time zone in that format as a mailbox setting](user_update_mailboxsettings.md). Subsequently you will be able to get the time zone in that format. Alternatively, you can manage the format conversion separately in your app.
