```

## Request body

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [plannerPlan](../resources/plannerplan.md) object.
The **plannerPlan** owner property must be set to an id of a [group](../resources/group.md) object.

When you create a new group by using [Create group](../api/group_post_groups.md), you are not added to the group as a member. After the group is created, add yourself as a member by using [group post members](../api/group_post_members.md).


## Response

If successful, this method returns `201 Created` response code and [plannerPlan](../resources/plannerplan.md) object in the response body.

This method can return any of the [HTTP status codes](../concepts/errors.md). The most common errors that apps should handle for this method are the 400, 403 and 404 responses. For more information about these errors, see [Common Planner error conditions](../resources/planner_overview.md#common-planner-error-conditions).
