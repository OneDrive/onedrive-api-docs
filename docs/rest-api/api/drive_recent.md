## Remarks

Some driveItems returned from the **recent** action will include the **remoteItem** facet which indicates they are items from another drive. 
To access the original driveItem object, you will need to make a request using the information provided in **remoteItem** in the following format:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored", "name": "drives-get-remoteitem" } -->

```http
GET /drives/{remoteItem-driveId}/items/{remoteItem-id}
```

<!-- {
  "type": "#page.annotation",
  "description": "Retrieve a list of recently used files for the owner of the drive.",
  "keywords": "drive,onedrive.drive,default drive",
  "section": "documentation",
  "tocPath": "Drives/Recent files"
} -->
