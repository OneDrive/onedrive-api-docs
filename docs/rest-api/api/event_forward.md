# event: forward

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

This action allows the organizer or attendee of a meeting [event](../resources/event.md) to forward the 
meeting request to a new recipient. 

If the meeting event is forwarded from an attendee's Office 365 mailbox to another recipient, this action 
also sends a message to notify the organizer of the forwarding, and adds the recipient to the organizer's 
copy of the meeting event. This convenience is not available when forwarding from an Outlook.com account.
