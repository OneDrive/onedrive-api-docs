# Get a site resource

Retrieve properties and relationships for a [site][] resource.
A **site** resource represents a team site in SharePoint.

[site]: ../resources/site.md

A **site** is addressed be a unique identifier which is a composite ID of the following values:

* Site collection hostname (contoso.sharepoint.com)
* Site collection unique ID (GUID)
* Site unique ID (GUID)

There is also a reserved site identifier, `root`, which always references the root site for a given target, as follows:

* `/sites/root`: The tenant root site.
* `/groups/{group-id}/sites/root`: The group's team site.

Additionally, the root site for a particular geographic instance (for multi-geo tenants) can be accessed with the geography's dataLocationCode, as follows:

* `/sites/NAM`: The root site of the tenant's North American instance
* `/sites/EUR`: The root site of the tenant's European instance
