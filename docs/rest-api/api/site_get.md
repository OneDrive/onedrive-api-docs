# Get a site resource

Retrieve properties and relationships for a [site][] resource.
A **site** resource represents a team site in SharePoint.

[site]: ../resources/site.md

A **site** is addressed be a unique identifier which is a composite ID of the following values:

* Site collection hostname (sp.contoso.com)
* Site collection unique ID (GUID)
* Site unique ID (GUID)

There is also a reserved site identifier, `root`, which always references the root site for a given target, as follows:

* `/sites/root`: The root site.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
