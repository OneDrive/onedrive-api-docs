# group: checkMemberGroups

Check for membership in the specified list of groups. Returns from the list those groups of which
the specified group has a direct or transitive membership.

You can check up to a maximum of 20 groups per request. This function supports Office 365 and other
types of groups provisioned in Azure AD. Note that Office 365 Groups cannot contain groups. So membership
in an Office 365 Group is always direct.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                 |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | ~~Group.Read.All~~, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                              |
| Application                            | _Group.Read.All_, Directory.Read.All. Directory.ReadWrite.All                               |

> **Note:** This API currently requires the `Directory.Read.All` permission or higher. Using the `Gorup.Read.All` permission will return an error. This is a known bug.
