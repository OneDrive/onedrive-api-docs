# group: getMemberGroups

Return all the groups that the specified group is a member of. The check is transitive, unlike reading the [memberOf](../api/group_list_memberof.md) navigation property, which returns only the groups that the group is a direct member of.

This function supports Office 365 and other types of groups provisioned in Azure AD. The maximum number of groups each
request can return is 2046. Note that Office 365 Groups cannot contain groups. So membership in an Office 365 Group is
always direct.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../concepts/permissions_reference.md).

| Permission type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)                                                 |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Delegated (work or school account)     | ~~Group.Read.All~~, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.                                                                              |
| Application                            | ~~Group.Read.All~~, Directory.Read.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All                             |

> **Note:** This API currently requires the `Directory.Read.All` permission or higher. Using the `Group.Read.All` permission will return an error. This is a known bug.
