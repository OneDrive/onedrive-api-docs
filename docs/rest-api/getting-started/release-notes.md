# Release notes for using Microsoft Graph with OneDrive for Business and SharePoint

Microsoft Graph provides a common API for accessing files from OneDrive personal, OneDrive for Business, and SharePoint.
However, while the API surface is common, these services may have slight differences in how the API works that you need to account for.
As much as possible the Microsoft Graph works to eliminate these differences, but this page calls out any that you may need to be aware of when working with Microsoft Graph.
