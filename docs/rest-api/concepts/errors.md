# Common error responses and codes

Errors in the OneDrive API are returned using standard HTTP status codes, as well as a JSON error
response object. The following HTTP status codes should be expected.

| Status code | Status message                  | Description                                                                                                                            |
|:------------|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 400         | Bad Request                     | Cannot process the request because it is malformed or incorrect.                                                                       |
| 401         | Unauthorized                    | Required authentication information is either missing or not valid for the resource.                                                   |
| 403         | Forbidden                       | Access is denied to the requested resource. The user might not have enough permission.                                                 |
| 404         | Not Found                       | The requested resource doesn’t exist.                                                                                                  |
| 405         | Method Not Allowed              | The HTTP method in the request is not allowed on the resource.                                                                         |
| 406         | Not Acceptable                  | This service doesn’t support the format requested in the Accept header.                                                                |
| 409         | Conflict                        | The current state conflicts with what the request expects. For example, the specified parent folder might not exist.                   |
| 410         | Gone                            | The requested resource is no longer available at the server.                                               |
| 411         | Length Required                 | A Content-Length header is required on the request.                                                                                    |
| 412         | Precondition Failed             | A precondition provided in the request (such as an if-match header) does not match the resource's current state.                       |
| 413         | Request Entity Too Large        | The request size exceeds the maximum limit.                                                                                            |
| 415         | Unsupported Media Type          | The content type of the request is a format that is not supported by the service.                                                      |
| 416         | Requested Range Not Satisfiable | The specified byte range is invalid or unavailable.                                                                                    |
| 422         | Unprocessable Entity            | Cannot process the request because it is semantically incorrect.                                                                       |
| 429         | Too Many Requests               | Client application has been throttled and should not attempt to repeat the request until an amount of time has elapsed.                |
| 500         | Internal Server Error           | There was an internal server error while processing the request.                                                                       |
| 501         | Not Implemented                 | The requested feature isn’t implemented.                                                                                               |
| 503         | Service Unavailable             | The service is temporarily unavailable. You may repeat the request after a delay. There may be a Retry-After header.                   |
| 507         | Insufficient Storage            | The maximum storage quota has been reached.                                                                                            |
| 509         | Bandwidth Limit Exceeded        | Your app has been throttled for exceeding the maximum bandwidth cap. Your app can retry the request again after more time has elapsed. |

The error response is a single JSON object that contains a single property
named **error**. This object includes all of the details of the error. You may use the information returned here instead of, or in addition
to the HTTP status code returned. Here is an example of a full JSON error body.

<!-- { "blockType": "example", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.error", "expectError": true, "name": "example-error-response"} -->

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalidRange",
    "message": "Uploaded fragment overlaps with existing data.",
    "innererror": {
      "code": "fragmentOverlap"
    }
  }
}
```

## The code property

The `code` property contains one of 15 possible values. Your apps must be
prepared to handle any one of these errors.

| Code                      | Description
|:--------------------------|:--------------
| **accessDenied**          | The caller doesn't have permission to perform the action. 
| **activityLimitReached**  | The app or user has been throttled.
| **generalException**      | An unspecified error has occurred.
| **invalidRange**          | The specified byte range is invalid or unavailable.
| **invalidRequest**        | The request is malformed or incorrect.
| **itemNotFound**          | The resource could not be found.
| **malwareDetected**       | Malware was detected in the requested resource.
| **nameAlreadyExists**     | The specified item name already exists.
| **notAllowed**            | The action is not allowed by the system.
| **notSupported**          | The request is not supported by the system.
| **resourceModified**      | The resource being updated has changed since the caller last read it, usually an eTag mismatch.
| **resyncRequired**        | The delta token is no longer valid, and the app must reset the sync state.
| **serviceNotAvailable**   | The service is not available. Try the request again after a delay. There may be a Retry-After header. 
| **quotaLimitReached**     | The user has reached their quota limit.
| **unauthenticated**       | The caller is not authenticated.

The `innererror` object may recursively contain more `innererror` objects
with additional, more specific error codes. When handling an error, apps
should loop through all the error codes available and use the most detailed
one that they understand. Some of the more detailed codes are listed at the
bottom of this page.

To verify that an error object is an error you are expecting, you must loop
over the `innererror` objects, looking for the error codes you expect. For example:

```csharp
public bool IsError(string expectedErrorCode)
{
    OneDriveInnerError errorCode = this.Error;
    while (null != errorCode)
    {
        if (errorCode.Code == expectedErrorCode)
            return true;
        errorCode = errorCode.InnerError;
    }
    return false;
}
```

For a complete example for properly handling errors, take a look at
[OneDrive Error Code Handling](https://gist.github.com/rgregg/a1866be15e685983b441).

The `message` property at the root contains an error message intended for the
developer to read. Error messages are not localized and shouldn't be displayed
directly to the user. When handling errors, your code should not key off of
`message` values because they can change at any time, and they often contain
dynamic information specific to the failed request. You should only code
against error codes returned in `code` properties.

For more information on the resource returned in the error response, see
the [Error resource type](../resources/error.md) topic.

## Detailed error codes

Below are some additional errors that your app may encounter within the nested
`innererror` objects. Apps are not required to handle these, but may if they
choose. The service may add new error codes or stop returning old ones at any
time, so it is important that all apps be able to handle the basic 15 [above](#the-code-property).
