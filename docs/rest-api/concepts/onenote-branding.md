## Logo variations

**Icon and name lockup** (Preferred)  
The icon symbol is locked with the name. This is the preferred graphic representation of the OneNote logo.

**Icon symbol**  
Certain environments, such as on small devices, don't provide enough room for the entire logo lockup. In those cases, the icon symbol alone may be used in an app or in digital marketing. When used in an app, use the icon symbol alone only when you need an icon or favicon to represent OneNote.

<a name="spacing"></a>
## Clear space 
Treat the logo with respect and give it room to breathe. A minimum clear space equivalent to the height of the symbol must surround the logo.

<a name="size"></a>
## Minimum size 
The logo should be at least 16 pixels high when it appears on-screen and at least 5 mm (0.2 inches) high when it appears in print.

**Screen:**&nbsp;&nbsp;16 pixels  
**Print:**&nbsp;&nbsp;5 mm (0.2 inches)

<a name="color"></a>
## Color
When the OneNote logo is used on white or light backgrounds, the preferred logo color is purple--its brand color. When it appears on a purple background, the logo should be knocked out to white.

**Screen:**&nbsp;&nbsp;R128 G57 B123 or Hex #80397B  
**Print:**&nbsp;&nbsp;C75 M100 Y0 K0

In color-limited environments and one-color designs, the logo can appear in black. However, the logo should never appear in gray.

## Referencing the OneNote name

**Full name:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft OneNote  
**Short name:**&nbsp;&nbsp;OneNote
 
Refer to the table below for details about how to refer to OneNote in various contexts.

| Context | Usage |
|------|------|
| App names | To avoid confusing consumers within the app stores, we prefer that *OneNote* not be included in the name of your app. If it’s determined that OneNote must be used in the app name, *OneNote* must be modified by a preposition (for example, *for OneNote* or *with OneNote*).<br /><br />Example:&nbsp;&nbsp;*Proseware for OneNote*<br /><br />Under no circumstances can the name of your app begin with OneNote.
| Publisher names | The publisher’s name may not include a reference to OneNote. The publisher’s name may not infringe upon any Microsoft trademarks. |
| Indicating interoperability with OneNote | **Recommended:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Send to OneNote<br /><br />**Acceptable:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Share with OneNote<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Acceptable when used in reference to "sharing" with other applications—for example, *Share with OneNote, Facebook, or Twitter.*)<br /><br />**Never:**&nbsp;&nbsp;Save to OneNote<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This is technically incorrect. |
| General marketing (including app descriptions) | The first mention in a communication should use the full name: *Microsoft OneNote*.<br /><br />Subsequent references in the communication can use the short name: *OneNote*.
