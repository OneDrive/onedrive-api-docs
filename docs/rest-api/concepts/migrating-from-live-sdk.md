# Migrating from Live SDK to Microsoft Graph

If you are using the Live SDK or Live Connect APIs to connect to profile, calendar, contacts, or files, your app needs to be updated to maintain functionality.

Live SDK and Live Connect APIs have been marked as deprecated for over a year. 
As announced on the [Office Developer blog](https://dev.office.com/blogs), these APIs are now end of life and will no longer be available after **November 1, 2018**.

Profile and contacts data will no longer be available from the Live Connect APIs as of **Decmeber 1, 2017**.
Calendar data has not been available from Live Connect since **June 2017**.

Live Connect APIs are all hosted from `https://apis.live.net/v5.0`. This prefix should be assumed in all of the examples below.

## Switching to Microsoft Graph

The functionality previously available through Live SDK and Live Connect APIs is available via [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com).
To continue to integrate with Microsoft services, developers must update their apps to use Microsoft Graph in advance of the timeline for the these services being discontinued.

Similar to the capabilities of Live Connect, Microsoft Graph has a number of resources available depending on the type of user data your app interacts with:

* [Microsoft account authentication](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/auth_overview)
* [OneDrive files](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/onedrive)
* [Outlook calendar](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/calendar)
* [Outlook messages](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/mail_api_overview)
* [Personal contacts](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/contact)
* [Profile and Identity API](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/api-reference/v1.0/resources/users)

## Libraries

Microsoft Graph offers [client libraries](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/code-samples-and-sdks) for many platforms that can integrate with your application similar to Live SDK.

## Permissions

Microsoft Graph uses a different set of permission scopes than Live Connect.
To access the Microsoft Graph APIs, your app will need to switch permission scopes.
This requires your app to prompt the user for consent to sign in and consent to the new permissions.

See the [Microsoft Graph permission reference](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference) for the complete details.

| Live Connect Scope      | Microsoft Graph Permission | Description                                                                                                                     |

## Unique Identifiers

Microsoft Graph uses a different scheme for unique identifiers than Live Connect or Live SDK.
You cannot use the identifiers from Live Connect with Microsoft Graph.

Your application will need to rediscover the identifiers for known items using search, path-based navigation, or asking the user to select the items again.

## Identity API

The identity API functionality will cease to return user data on **December 1, 2017**.

The following table outlines methods in the Live Connect API and the equivelent method in Microsoft Graph.
While the format of the REST path may be similar, the response data does not follow the same format.
You will need to use the Microsoft Graph SDK or update your JSON mapping to use the Microsoft Graph resource format.

## File Picker for web apps

The OneDrive file picker functionality that was provided as part of the Live SDK is now available through the [OneDrive file picker](../../controls/file-pickers/index.md).

Version 5 of the Live SDK (OneDrive file picker) will no longer be functional after **November 1, 2018**.
