# Case sensitivity notes

This topic describes the case sensitivity for parts of the OneDrive REST API in detail.

## OneDrive URLs

The URL scheme and authority (DNS name) are treated as case-insensitive.
The URL path may have case-sensitive or case-insensitive components, depending on the type of resource being addressed.
Be sure to consider everything documented here.

### Resource identifiers

Resource identifiers like **drive-id**, **item-id** are case-sensitive.

### Path identifiers

File system path identifiers used with colons (such as `:/Documents/MyFile.xlsx`) and filenames specified in the URL (such as 'MyFile.xlsx' in `/items/{item-id}/children/MyFile.xlsx`) are _not_ case-sensitive.

For example, the path `:/Folder-A/Foo.txt` is treated the same as `:/folder-a/foo.TXT`. Likewise, the path `/items/{item-id}/children/Foo.txt` is treated the same as `/items/{item-id}/children/FOO.TxT`.

Metadata path identifiers, such as '/items/{item-id}/image' are case-sensitive.

## Query parameters

The request query parameter names are case-sensitive. For example, `?select` is _not_ the same as `?SELECT`.

## Request headers

Per [HTTP 1.1 protocol][http-protocol], request header names are not case-sensitive. For example, `Content-Type` would be treated the same as `content-type`.

The request header values are case-sensitive.
For example, when providing an eTag or cTag value in an `if-match` header, the tag is case-sensitive.

## JSON request body

The keys of the JSON object supplied in the request body are case-sensitive.
The value supplied in name-value pairs is stored as-is into the service.

## JSON response body

In the JSON response, the property names are camel-cased.
The value of the property (such as item name) is returned as stored in OneDrive.
