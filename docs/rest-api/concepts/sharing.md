# Sharing items in OneDrive and SharePoint

OneDrive Personal, OneDrive for Business, and SharePoint provide two different
primary ways to share items with other users:

* **Sharing links** make it easy to share files with anyone who has the link. The link
  includes the authentication required to access the file and allows either read
  or read-write access to the shared item.
* **Permissions** on the item allow it to be shared with specific users who must be
  signed in to access the files.

OneDrive API supports creating both sharing links and item permissions.

## Tasks for sharing items
