# Permissions for OneDrive API

OneDrive and SharePoint expose a few granular permissions that control the access that apps have to resources.
When a user signs in to your app they, or, in some cases, an administrator, are required to consent to these permissions.
If consent is given, your app is given access to the resources and APIs that it has requested.
For apps that don't take a signed-in user, permissions can be pre-consented to by an administrator when the app is installed or during sign-up. 

For more details about the full set of Microsoft Graph permissions, please see [Permissions reference for Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference).
