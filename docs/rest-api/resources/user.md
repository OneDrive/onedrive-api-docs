# user resource type

Represents an Azure AD user account. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
- Using [delta query](../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user_delta.md) function.
