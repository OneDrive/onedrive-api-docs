# plannerUserIds resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

The **plannerUserIds** resource represents the list of users ids that a [plan](plannerplan.md) is shared with. This is an Open Type. If you are leveraging Office 365 Groups, use the Groups API to manage group membership to share the [group's](group.md) plan. You can also add existing members of the group to this collection though it is not required for them to access the plan owned by the group.


## Properties
Properties of an Open Type can be defined by the client. In this case, the client should provide user ids as properties with their values being the `true` boolean. When user ids are no longer shared with, properties are automatically removed by setting their values to the `false` boolean.
