# Use the Microsoft Graph API to work with Microsoft Teams

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace in Office 365 that provides built-in access to team-specific calendars, files, OneNote notes, Planner plans, and more.

## Membership changes in Microsoft Teams

When adding members to or removing members from a team using the Microsoft Graph v1.0 endpoint,
there is a delay before the membership changes are reflected in the Microsoft Teams application/website.
If a current team member or owner is signed in to the Microsoft Teams application/website,
the change will be reflected within an hour.
If none of those users are signed in to the Microsoft Teams application/website
the change will not be reflected until an hour after one of them signs in.

The beta endpoint is faster -- under a minute in most cases,
regardless of whether the user is logged in or not.
Here are the beta APIs to use:

| Use case      | Verb      | URL |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Add member](../api/group_post_members.md)	| POST	    | https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}/members/$ref  |
| [Remove member](../api/group_delete_members.md)	| DELETE	| https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}/members/{userId}/$ref |
| [Add owner](../api/group_post_owners.md)     | POST	    | https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}/owners/$ref |
| [Remove owner](../api/group_delete_owners.md)	| DELETE	| https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/groups/{id}/owners/{userId}/$ref |
| [Update team](../api/team_update.md)	| PATCH     | https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/teams/{id} |

When adding owners, regardless of which endpoint use, you will generally want to add that user as a member as well. 
If you have an owner that's not also a member, different apps and APIs will handle that differently. 
For instance, Microsoft Teams will show teams that the user is either a member or an owner of, 
while the Teams PowerShell cmdlets and the /me/joinedTeams API will only show teams the user is a member of. 
To avoid confusion, consider having all owners also be on the members list.


## Teams and groups

In Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Teams is represented by a [group](../resources/group.md) resource. Both Microsoft Teams and Office 365 groups address 
the various needs of group collaboration. Almost all the group-based features apply to Microsoft Teams and 
Office 365 groups, such as group calendar, files, notes, photo, plans, and so on. The main difference between a team and an Office 365 group is the mode of communication 
between members. Team members communicate by persistent chat in the context of a specific team. Office 365 group members communicate by group conversations, 
which are email conversations that occur in the context of a group in Outlook.

The following are the differences at the API level between teams and groups: 

- Persistent chat is available only to Microsoft Teams. This feature is hierarchically represented by the 
[channel](../resources/channel.md), [chatThread](../resources/chatthread.md), and [chatMessage](../resources/chatmessage.md) resources.
- Group conversations are available only to Office 365 groups. This feature is hierarchically represented by 
the [conversation](../resources/conversation.md), [conversationThread](../resources/conversationthread.md), and [post](../resources/post.md) resources. 
- The [List joined teams](../api/user_list_joinedteams.md) method applies only to Microsoft Teams.
- See also the [known issues](../concepts/known_issues.md) for these APIs.

>**Note:** If you use the groups API in a [Microsoft Teams app](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/index#apps-in-microsoft-teams) 
rather than in a standalone app - for example as part of a tab or bot running in Microsoft Teams - follow the guidance in the article 
[Using Microsoft Graph in your Microsoft Teams pages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/graph).
