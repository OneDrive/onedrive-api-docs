# group resource type

Represents an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group, which can be an Office 365 group, a dynamic group, or a security group.
Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
- Using [delta query](../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user_delta.md) function.
