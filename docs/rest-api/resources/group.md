# group resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Represents an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group, which can be an Office 365 group, a team in Microsoft Teams, a dynamic group, or a security group.
Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource supports:

- Adding your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).
- Using [delta query](../concepts/delta_query_overview.md) to track incremental additions, deletions, and updates, by providing a [delta](../api/user_delta.md) function.

> **Microsoft Teams and Office 365 groups support group collaboration**. You can use most of the Office 365 groups API with Microsoft Teams. To create a [team](team.md), first  [create group](../api/group_post_groups.md) and then [add a team to it](../api/team_put_teams.md). For details, see the [Microsoft Teams overview](teams_api_overview.md).
