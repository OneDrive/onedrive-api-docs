# File resource type

The **File** resource groups file-related data items into a single structure.

If a [**DriveItem**](driveitem.md) has a non-null **file** facet, the item represents an file.
In addition to other properties, files have a **content** relationship which contains the byte stream of the file.

## JSON representation

Here is a JSON representation of the resource.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "resource",
  "optionalProperties": [ ],
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.file"
}-->

```json
{
  "hashes": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.hashes"},
  "mimeType": "string",
  "processingMetadata": false
}
```
