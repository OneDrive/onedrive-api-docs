A scoped-role membership describes a user's membership of a directory role, that is further scoped to an Administrative Unit (AU).  This provides a mechanism to allow a tenant-wide company adminsistrator to delegate administrative privileges to a user to manage users and groups in a subset of the organization (the subset being defined by an AU).

## Methods
