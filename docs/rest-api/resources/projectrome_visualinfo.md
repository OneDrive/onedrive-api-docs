# visualInfo resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

A complex type for representing the **visualElements** property in the [activity](../resources/projectrome_activity.md) object.

Each user activity will be shown in Timeline as an Adaptive Card. App developers are encouraged to provide a custom Card which captures the essence of the activity which took place in your app. This is possible by providing a custom JSON card in the content property.

In addition to visual metadata with an Adaptive Card, app can specify content metadata – data that be used to build inferences on the user’s activity in order to offer new activities for future re-engagement. This is possible by using the activity's contentInfo property to provide a JSON object which leverages schema.org properties to describe the content.

If a custom card is not provided, a simple card will be generated using displayText and description properties. Custom cards are recommended to showcase the best content from within your app.

## Properties

|Name | Type | Description|
|:----|:------|:-----------|
|displayText | String | Required. Short text description of the user's unique activity (for example, document name in cases where an activity refers to document creation)|
|description | String | Optional. Longer text description of the user's unique activity (example: document name, first sentence, and/or metadata)|
|backgroundColor | String | Optional. Background color used to render the activity in the UI - brand color for the application source of the activity. Must be a valid hex color|
|content | Untyped JSON object | Optional. Custom piece of data - JSON object used to provide custom content to render the activity in the Windows Shell UI|
|attribution | [imageInfo](../resources/projectrome_imageinfo.md) | Optional. JSON object used to represent an icon which represents the application used to generate the activity|
