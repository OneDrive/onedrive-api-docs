> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

An image or other file resource on a OneNote page. 

You can get the binary data of a resource, but getting a JSON representation of a resource object or a resource collection is not supported.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "resource",
  "optionalProperties": [

  ],
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.onenoteResource"
}-->

Get the binary data of a specific resource by sending a GET request to the resource's `content` endpoint:

```
GET ../onenote/resources/{id}/content
```

The file's resource URI is returned when you get a page's HTML content using the following request:

```
GET ../onenote/pages/{id}/content
```

In the page HTML, an `img` tag includes endpoints for the original image resource in the `data-fullres-src` attribute and the optimized image in the `src` attribute:
```
<img 
    src="image-resource-url"  
    data-src-type="media-type"
    data-fullres-src="image-resource-url"  
    data-fullres-src-type="media-type" ... />
```

An `object` tag (which represents files such as PDF, DOCX, and PNG) includes the endpoint for the file resource in the `data` attribute:

```
<object
    data="file-resource-url"
    data-attachment="file-name.file-type" 
    type="media-type" ... />
```
