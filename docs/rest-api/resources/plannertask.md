# plannerTask resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

The **plannerTask** resource represents a Planner task in Office 365. A Planner task is contained in a [plan](plannerplan.md) and can be assigned to a [bucket](plannerbucket.md) in a plan. Each task object has a [details](plannertaskdetails.md) object which can contain more information about the task. See [overview](planner_overview.md) for more information regarding relationships between group, plan and task.
