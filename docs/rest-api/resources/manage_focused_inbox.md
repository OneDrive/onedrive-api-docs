# Manage Focused Inbox

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Focused Inbox allows you to view important messages in the `Focused` tab of the Inbox, and the rest of the Inbox messages in the `Other` tab. The classification system 
initially organizes Inbox messages in a default way. You can correct and train the system over time through the user interface or programmatically. The more you use it, 
the better the system can infer which incoming message as important.

At the programmatic level, the Focused Inbox REST API works on the specified user's messages, and supports an **inferenceClassification** property for each message. 
The possible values are `Focused` and `Other`, which indicate whether the user 
considers that message as, respectively, more important and less important. To correct how the system classifies a message, 
[update the inferenceClassification property of that message](../api/message_update.md). Over time, these corrections also train the message classification system.

The Focused Inbox REST API also lets you create overrides. Each override, represented by an 
[inferenceClassificationOverride](../resources/inferenceClassificationOverride.md) instance, is an instruction for the 
classification system to always designate messages from a specific sender in a consistent way 
(i.e., always as "Focused" or always as "Other"), regardless of any previously learned approach. You can [create](../api/inferenceclassification_post_overrides.md), 
[list](../api/inferenceclassification_list_overrides.md), [update](../api/inferenceclassificationoverride_update.md) and [delete](../api/inferenceclassificationoverride_delete.md) 
overrides for the specified user. That user's overrides, if any, are accessible in an **inferenceClassification** navigation 
property, which is a collection of **inferenceClassificationOverride** instances. Overrides allow a 
user more control over the classification of incoming messages, and build greater trust of the classification system.

Note that the classification system learns and applies classification only on incoming messages in the Inbox. Messages in other folders are by default "Focused". 
Setting up an override affects future messages arriving in the Inbox; the override doesn't modify the **inferenceClassification** property in existing messages in any folder 
including the Inbox.
