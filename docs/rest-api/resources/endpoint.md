# Endpoint resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Endpoints represent URLs for resources associated with an entity.  For example, when a new Office 365 group is created, additional resources are also created as part of the Office 365 group. These include things like a group mailbox for conversations and a group OneDrive folder for documents and files. Further information about these Office 365 group resources, including their associated resource URLs can now be read using the *endpoints* navigation on the group resource-type. This allows applications to understand these resources, and even embed the resource URL experiences in their own experiences.
