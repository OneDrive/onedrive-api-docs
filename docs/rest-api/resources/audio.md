# Audio facet

The **Audio** resource groups audio-related properties on an item into a single structure.

If a [**DriveItem**](driveitem.md) has a non-null **audio** facet, the item represents an audio file.
The properties of the **Audio** resource are populated by extracting metadata from the file.
