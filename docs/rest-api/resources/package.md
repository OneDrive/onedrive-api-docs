# Package resource type

The **Package** resource indicates that a DriveItem is the top level item in a "package" or a collection of items that should be treated as a collection instead of individual items.

An example of a package is a OneNote notebook. 
While the notebook is made up of files and folders that represent the contents of the notebook, the top level item that represents the notebook has a **package** facet to indicate to clients that this is a collection of data that should be treated special.

DriveItems with the **package** facet do not include a **folder** or **file** facet but are conceptually similar to an item with a **folder** facet.

## JSON representation
