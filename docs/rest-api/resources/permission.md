# Permission resource type

The **Permission** resource provides information about a sharing permission granted for a [DriveItem](driveitem.md) resource.

Sharing permissions have a number of different forms.
The **Permission** resource represents these different forms through facets on the resource.

## JSON representation

Here is a JSON representation of the resource

<!-- {
  "blockType": "resource",
  "optionalProperties": [ "link", "grantedTo", "invitation", "inheritedFrom", "shareId" ],
  "keyProperty": "id",
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission"
}-->
```json
{
  "id": "string (identifier)",
  "grantedTo": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.identitySet"},
  "inheritedFrom": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.itemReference"},
  "invitation": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.sharingInvitation"},
  "link": {"@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.sharingLink"},
  "roles": ["string"],
  "shareId": "string"
}
```

## Properties

| Property      | Type                                      | Description
|:--------------|:------------------------------------------|:-----------------
| id            | String                                    | The unique identifier of the permission among all permissions on the item. Read-only.
| grantedTo     | [IdentitySet](identityset.md)             | For user type permissions, the details of the users & applications for this permission. Read-only.
| invitation    | [SharingInvitation][]                     | Details of any associated sharing invitation for this permission. Read-only.
| inheritedFrom | [ItemReference](itemreference.md)         | Provides a reference to the ancestor of the current permission, if it is inherited from an ancestor. Read-only.
| link          | [SharingLink][]                           | Provides the link details of the current permission, if it is a link type permissions. Read-only.
| role          | Collection of String                      | The type of permission, e.g. `read`. See below for the full list of roles. Read-only.
| shareId       | String                                    | A unique token that can be used to access this shared item via the [**shares** API](../api/shares_get.md). Read-only.

The permission resource uses _facets_ to provide information about the kind of permission represented by the resource.

Permissions with a [**link**][SharingLink] facet represent sharing links created on the item. 
Sharing links contain a unique token that provides access to the item for anyone with the link.

Permissions with an [**invitation**][SharingInvitation] facet represent permissions added by inviting specific users or groups to have access to the file.

[SharingInvitation]: sharinginvitation.md
[SharingLink]: sharinglink.md

## Roles enumeration

| Role        | Details                                                                        |
|:------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `read`      | Provides the ability to read the metadata and contents of the item.            |
| `write`     | Provides the ability to read and modify the metadata and contents of the item. |
| `sp.owner`  | For SharePoint and OneDrive for Business this represents the owner role.       |
| `sp.member` | For SharePoint and OneDrive for Business this represents the member role.      |

## Sharing links
The most common type of permissions are sharing links.
Sharing links provide a unique URL that includes both the resource being shared
and an authentication token that provides access to the resource. Users don't
need to sign-in to access the content shared with a sharing link. Users can
share a link that gives read-only access to the content or writable access to
the content.

### View Link
A view link provides read-only access to an item.

<!-- {"blockType": "example", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission", "name": "permission-view-link" } -->
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "roles": ["read"],
  "link": {
    "type": "view",
    "webUrl": "https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5D33DD65C6932946!70859&authkey=!AL7N1QAfSWcjNU8&ithint=folder%2cgif",
    "application": { "id": "1234", "displayName": "Sample Application" }
  },
  "shareId": "!LKj1lkdlals90j1nlkascl"
}
```

### Edit link
An edit link provides read and write access to an item.

<!-- {"blockType": "example", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission", "name": "permission-edit-link" } -->
```json
{
  "id": "2",
  "roles": ["write"],
  "link": {
    "type": "edit",
    "webUrl": "https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=5D33DD65C6932946!70859&authkey=!AL7N1QAfSWcjNU8&ithint=folder%2cgif",
    "application": { "id": "1234", "displayName": "Sample Application" }
  },
  "shareId": "!LKj1lkdlals90j1nlkascl"
}
```

### Sharing Invitation
In addition to creating sharing links, a user can be invited by e-mail address.
In this scenario the permission creates an invitation that is sent to the user's
email.

#### Invitation to an email address
If the permission was sent via an email address to a recipient who does not have
a matching account, the **grantedTo** property may not be set until the
invitation is redeemed, which occurs the first time a user clicks the link and
signs in.

<!-- {"blockType": "example", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission", "name": "permission-invite-email" } -->
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "roles": ["write"],
  "invitation": {
    "email": "jd@gmail.com",
    "signInRequired": true
  },
  "shareId": "FWxc1lasfdbEAGM5fI7B67aB5ZMPDMmQ11U"
}
```

After the sharing invitation has been redeemed by a user, the **grantedTo**
property will contain the information about the account that redeemed the permissions:

<!-- {"blockType": "example", "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.permission", "name": "permission-invite-redeemed" } -->
```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "roles": ["write"],
  "grantedTo": {
    "user": {
      "id": "5D33DD65C6932946",
      "displayName": "John Doe"
    }
  },
  "invitation": {
    "email": "jd@outlook.com",
    "signInRequired": true
  },
  "shareId": "FWxc1lasfdbEAGM5fI7B67aB5ZMPDMmQ11U"
}
```
