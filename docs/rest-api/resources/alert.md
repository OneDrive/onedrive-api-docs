# alert resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Represents potential security issues within a customer's tenant that Microsoft or partner security solutions have identified. Use alerts to unify and streamline security issue management across all integrated solutions. To learn more, see the sample queries in [Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/graph-explorer).

Alerts can be retrieved from the following Providers: Azure Security Center, and Azure Active Directory Identity Protection. Additional Alert Providers will integrate in the following months.
