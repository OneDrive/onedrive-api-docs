# DriveItem resource type

The **driveItem** resource represents a file, folder, or other item stored in a drive.
All file system objects in OneDrive and SharePoint are returned as **driveItem** resources.

There are two primary ways of addressing a **driveItem** resource:

* By the **driveItem** unique identifier using `drive/items/{item-id}`
* By file system path using `/drive/root:/path/to/file`

**DriveItem** resources have facets modeled as properties that provide data about the driveItem's identities and capabilities.
For example:

* Folders have a [**folder facet**][folder]
* Files have a [**file facet**][file].
* Images have an [**image facet**][image] in addition to their file facet.
* Images taken with a camera (photos) have a [**photo facet**][photo] that identifies the item as a photo and provides the properties of when the photo was taken and with what device.

Items with the **folder** facet act as containers of items and therefore have a `children` reference pointing to a collection of **driveItems** under the folder.

## JSON representation

Here is a JSON representation of a **driveItem** resource.

The **driveItem** resource is derived from [**baseItem**][baseItem] and inherits properties from that resource.

## Instance Attributes

Instance attributes are properties with special behaviors.
These properties are temporary and either a) define behavior the service should perform or b) provide short-term property values, like a download URL for an item that expires.

| Property name                     | Type   | Description
|:----------------------------------|:-------|:--------------------------------
| @microsoft.graph.conflictBehavior | string | The conflict resolution behavior for actions that create a new item. You can use the values *fail*, *replace*, or *rename*. The default for PUT is *replace*. An item will never be returned with this annotation. Write-only.
| @microsoft.graph.downloadUrl      | string | A URL that can be used to download this file's content. Authentication is not required with this URL. Read-only.
| @microsoft.graph.sourceUrl        | string | When issuing a PUT request, this instance annotation can be used to instruct the service to download the contents of the URL, and store it as the file. Write-only.

**Note:** The @microsoft.graph.downloadUrl value is a short-lived URL and can't be cached.
The URL will only be available for a short period of time (1 hour) before it is invalidated.
