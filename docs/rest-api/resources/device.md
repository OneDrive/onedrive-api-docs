# device resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Represents a device registered in the directory. Devices are created in the cloud using the Device Registration Service or by Intune. They're used by conditional access policies for multi-factor authentication. These devices can range from desktop and laptop machines to phones and tablets. Inherits from [directoryObject](directoryobject.md).

This resource lets you add your own data to custom properties using [extensions](../concepts/extensibility_overview.md).

|onPremisesLastSyncDateTime|DateTimeOffset|The last time at which the object was synced with the on-premises directory.The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'` Read-only. |
|onPremisesSyncEnabled|Boolean|**true** if this object is synced from an on-premises directory; **false** if this object was originally synced from an on-premises directory but is no longer synced; **null** if this object has never been synced from an on-premises directory (default). Read-only.|
