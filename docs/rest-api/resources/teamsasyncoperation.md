# teamsAsyncOperation resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

A Microsoft Teams async operation is an operation that transcends the lifetime of a single API request. 
These operations are long-running or too expensive to complete within the timeframe of their originating request.

When an async operation is initiated, the method returns a 202 Accepted response code. 
The response will also contain a Location header, which contains the location of the teamsAsyncOperation. 
Periodically check the status of the operation by making a GET request to this location; wait >30 seconds between checks.
When the request completes successfully, the status will be "succeeded" and the targetResourceLocation will point to the created/modified resource.
