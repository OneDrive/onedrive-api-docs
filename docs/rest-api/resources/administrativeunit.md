# administrativeUnit resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

An administrative unit provides a conceptual container for User and Group directory objects. Using administrative units, a company administrator can now delegate administrative responsibilities to manage the users and groups contained within or scoped to an administrative unit to a regional or departmental administrator.

Let's look at an example. Imagine that Contoso Corp is made up of two divisions - a West Coast Division and an East Coast Division. Directory roles at Contoso are scoped to the entire tenant. Lee, a Contoso company administrator, wants to delegate administrative responsibilities, but scope them to the West Coast Division or the East Coast division.  Lee can create a *West Coast admistrative unit* and place all West Coast users into this administrative unit.  Similarly, Lee can create an *East Coast adminstrative unit*.  Now Lee, can start delegating administrative responsibilities to others, but **scoped** to the new administrative units he's created. Lee places Jennifer in a *helpdesk administrator* role **scoped** to the *West Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Jennifer to reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *West Coast administrative unit*.  Similarly, Lee places Dave in a *user account administrator* role **scoped** to the *East Coast administrative unit*.  This allows Dave to update users, assign licenses and reset any user's password, but only if those users are in the *East Coast administrative unit*.
