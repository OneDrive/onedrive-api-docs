# Drive resource type

The drive resource is the top level object representing a user's OneDrive or a document library in SharePoint.

OneDrive users will always have at least one drive available, their default drive.
Users without a OneDrive license may not have a default drive available.

## JSON representation

Here is a JSON representation of a Drive resource.

The **drive** resource is derived from [**baseItem**](baseitem.md) and inherits properties from that resource.
