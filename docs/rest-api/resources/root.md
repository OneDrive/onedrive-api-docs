# Root resource type

The **Root** facet indicates that an object is the top-most one in its hierarchy.
The presence (non-null) of the facet value indicates that the object is the root.
A null (or missing) value indicates the object is not the root.

**Note**: While this facet is empty today, in future API revisions the facet may be populated with additional properties.
