# SharingLink resource type

The **SharingLink** resource groups link-related data items into a single structure.

If a [**Permission**](permission.md) resource has a non-null **sharingLink** facet, the permission represents a sharing link (as opposed to permissions granted to a person or group).

## JSON representation

Here is a JSON representation of the resource.

<!-- {
  "blockType": "resource",
  "optionalProperties": [ "application", "scope" ],
  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.sharingLink"
}-->

```json
{
  "application": { "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.identity" },
  "type": "view | edit | embed",
  "scope": "anonymous | organization",
  "webHtml": "string",
  "webUrl": "url"
}
```

## Properties

| Property       | Type          | Description
|:---------------|:--------------|:-------------------------------------
| application    | [identity][]  | The app the link is associated with.
| type           | String        | The type of the link created.
| scope          | String        | The scope of the link represented by this permission. Value `anonymous` indicates the link is usable by anyone, `organization` indicates the link is only usable for users signed into the same tenant.

| webUrl         | String        | A URL that opens the item in the browser on the OneDrive website.
