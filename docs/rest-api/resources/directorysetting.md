# directorySetting resource type

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Directory settings can be created based on the available [directorySettingTemplates](directorySettingTemplate.md), and changed from their preset defaults. These settings can govern entity or feature behaviors, both at a tenant-wide level or at a specific entity level. When the same setting is defined at both the tenant-wide and specific entity level, the specific entity level setting may opt-out from the tenant-wide setting.  For example, the tenant-wide setting may allow guests to be invited by existing members of groups, but a specific group setting may opt-out and not allow guests to be invited by members of the group. Currently system defined settings are only govern Office groups behavior.

> **Note**: The /beta version of the directorySetting resource type only applies to groups. The /v1.0 version has been renamed to groupSetting.
