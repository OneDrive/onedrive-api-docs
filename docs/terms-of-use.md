# OneDrive API Terms and Conditions

Last Updated: February 16, 2015.

1. Thank you for developing with OneDrive! This agreement (the “Agreement”) governs
   your use of the (i) OneDrive APIs; (ii) Microsoft Account Service APIs (the
   foregoing are collectively referred to as the "APIs"); and is a contract between
   you and Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of any of
   the OneDrive APIs is governed by this Agreement. You acknowledge that Microsoft
   has a [Microsoft Services Agreement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=137876)
   and [Microsoft Online Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=74170)
   with its customers for OneDrive and Microsoft account (the “Microsoft Services”), and
   agree that your use of any of the OneDrive APIs will not contravene Microsoft’s
   obligations under the Microsoft Services Agreement and Microsoft Online Privacy
   Statement. **Please note that we do not provide warranties for the OneDrive APIs.
   This Agreement also limits our liability. These terms are in Sections 10 and 11
   and we ask you to read them carefully.**

   These terms may be updated from time to time and, if we do so, we’ll notify
   you before the change takes effect. If you don’t agree to the change, you must
   cancel and stop using the service before the change becomes effective.
   Otherwise, the new terms will apply to you.

2. **License to use the APIs.** Subject to your compliance with this Agreement,
   Microsoft grants you and your Affiliates (Affiliates means any legal entity
   that owns, is owned by, or is commonly owned with a party. “Own” means more
   than 50% ownership or the right to direct the management of the entity.) a
   non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, revocable, limited license to
   install, use and make calls to the APIs to develop and/or host an application
   that is designed to access and use the Microsoft Services (an "Authorized
   Application").

   An "Authorized Application" for purposes of this Agreement is an application,
   such as (a) a web or client-based application, in object code form, or (b)
   those portions of your gateway server (“server interfaces”), that are
   designed to provide access to the Microsoft Services, and that (i) you make
   available for download (e.g., via your website or an application store),
   (ii) you make accessible through your service, or (iii) you pre-install and
   embed on your device(s).

3. **The OneDrive API Usage Guidelines.** In using the OneDrive APIs and developing
   and/or hosting Authorized Applications, you will comply with documentation,
   applicable to you, and provided to you by Microsoft through the developer
   center.

4. **Limitations and Conditions of the Services.** Microsoft provides the
   OneDrive APIs for the benefit of itself and its customers. We may use
   technology or other means of enforcement if, in our sole and absolute
   discretion, you or your Authorized Application violate any of the terms of
   this Agreement or pose a threat to us, our services, or our customers. This
   may include, for example, filtering to stop spam or restricting
   (or “throttling”) the functionality of the Microsoft Services, the OneDrive
   APIs. In such event, we will provide you with reasonable notice regarding
   such intended action and will give you a reasonable opportunity to resolve
   the issue which has given rise to the intended action.

   You will permit us reasonable access to your Authorized Application for
   purposes of monitoring compliance with this Agreement. If an Authorized
   Application can only be accessed through accounts that are not generally made
   available to the public, on request, you will provide us with at least one
   free account in order to facilitate our ability to access the Authorized
   Application.

   You will notify the end user if your Authorized Application requires the
   installation of any Microsoft application that has not yet been installed on
   that end user’s computer, and you will not in any way interfere with any
   verification system used by Microsoft to confirm that such end users have
   consented to the installation of those Microsoft applications. You will
   ensure that your policies, guidelines, codes, and similar documents for the
   Authorized Applications do not conflict with any of your responsibilities
   under this Agreement.

5. **Your Content.** Except for material that we license to you, we don’t claim
   ownership of the content you provide on the service and/or your Authorized
   Application. We also don’t control, verify, or endorse the content that you
   and others make available.

   You understand that Microsoft may need, and you hereby grant Microsoft the
   right, to use, modify, adapt, reproduce, distribute, and display content
   made available through the OneDrive APIs solely to the extent necessary to
   provide the OneDrive APIs, or Microsoft Services. No license or conveyance
   under any trade secret, copyright, or other law is granted by you to
   Microsoft under this Agreement.

   Please respect the rights of artists, inventors and creators. Content such as
   music, photos, and video may be protected by copyright. People appearing in
   content may have a right to control the use of their image. If you share
   content on the Microsoft Services in a way that infringes others’ copyrights,
   other intellectual property rights, or privacy rights, you are in breach this
   Agreement. You represent and warrant that you have all the rights necessary
   for you to grant the rights in this section and that the use of the content
   doesn’t violate any law. We won’t pay you for your content. We may refuse to
   publish or remove your content for any or no reason.

6. **Privacy.**

  a. **Your Information.** See the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.mspx)
     for disclosures relating to the collection and use of your information.

  b. **End User Information.** Where an Authorized Application seeks permission
     from an end user to access, collect, or transmit any user’s personal
     information from Microsoft Services, you must maintain a privacy policy.
     **You are responsible for informing end users of your privacy policy. Your
     privacy policy must (i) comply with applicable laws and regulations, (ii)
     inform end users of the information collected by you and how that
     information is used, stored, secured and disclosed, and (iii) describe the
     controls that end users have over the use and sharing of their information,
     and how they may access their information. You must also provide access to
     your privacy policy in the Authorized Application. Unauthorized use of end
     users’ personal information or email addresses will be subject to immediate
     revocation of your Client ID.**

   The Authorized Application must also provide a link to
   [https://account.live.com/consent/Manage](https://account.live.com/consent/Manage),
   or such other location as we may specify from time to time, with a clear
   indication that end users can go to that Microsoft site to revoke such
   permission at any time. If end users must take additional steps to disable
   the Authorized Application's access to end user information, then the
   Authorized Application must clearly indicate to end users the additional
   steps required to disable access. These requirements do not apply where
   Microsoft provides the end user interface.

7. **Indemnification.** You will indemnify and hold the Microsoft parties
   harmless from and against any and all loss, liability, and expense (including
   reasonable attorneys' fees) suffered or incurred by reason of any claims,
   proceedings or suits based on or arising out of (i) any breach by you of any
   obligation, representation or warranty under (ii) this agreement, and (iii)
   if you have or do become a licensee under the OneDrive APIs License Agreement,
   or (iv) alleged infringement or violation of any third party's rights by any
   materials or content made available to us by you through the use of the APIs
   or that we may access through use of your APIs. You will be solely responsible
   for defending any claim, subject to  Microsoft's right to participate with
   counsel it selects, and you will not agree to any settlement that imposes
   any obligation or liability on Microsoft without Microsoft's prior written consent.

8. **Reservation of Rights.** Except for the rights expressly granted under this
   Agreement, Microsoft and its suppliers retain all right, title and interest
   in and to the OneDrive APIs, Microsoft Services, and all intellectual
   property rights therein.

9. **Term.** This Agreement will become effective on your first use of the
   OneDrive APIs. You or Microsoft may terminate this Agreement immediately for
   any reason or no reason without notice. If this Agreement terminates, all
   rights granted to you by this Agreement will automatically terminate.

10. **NO WARRANTIES.**

   **MICROSOFT, AND OUR AFFILIATES, RESELLERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND VENDORS, MAKE
   NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO
   YOUR USE OF THE ONEDRIVE APIS AND THE SERVICES. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF
   THE ONEDRIVE APIS, AND THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND THAT WE PROVIDE
   THE ONEDRIVE APIS, AND THE SERVICES ON AN “AS IS” BASIS “WITH ALL FAULTS” AND
   "AS AVAILABLE." MICROSOFT DOESN'T GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF
   INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM THE SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR
   LOCAL LAW, WE EXCLUDE ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING FOR MERCHANTABILITY,
   SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WORKMANLIKE EFFORT,
   AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. YOU MAY HAVE CERTAIN RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAW.
   NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT IS INTENDED TO AFFECT THOSE RIGHTS, IF THEY ARE
   APPLICABLE.**

   **YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS ARE NOT
   FAULT-FREE AND OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF DOWNTIME OCCUR. WE DON'T GUARANTEE
   THE ONEDRIVE APIS, AND THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE,
   OR ERROR-FREE OR THAT CONTENT LOSS WON'T OCCUR.**

   **YOU MAY BE ABLE TO ACCESS THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES OR SERVICES VIA THE ONEDRIVE
   APIS; YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR SUCH WEBSITES OR
   SERVICES OR CONTENT THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE THERE.**

11. **LIABILITY LIMITATION.**

    **YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS AFFILIATES ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP
    TO USD $1.00. YOU AGREE NOT TO SEEK AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RECOVER ANY
    OTHER LOSSES OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST
    PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. THESE LIMITS
    AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY EVEN IF MICROSOFT KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE
    POSSIBILITY OF THE DAMAGES. THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
    TO YOU BECAUSE YOUR STATE OR COUNTRY MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN
    DAMAGES.**

12. **Changes to the Service; Cancellation of the Service.**

    We may change the OneDrive APIs, or Microsoft Services at any time and for
    any reason, **with or without notice. Such changes may include removal of
    features, or the requirement of fees for previously free features.** Some
    changes may cause existing Authorized Applications to stop working and, in
    these circumstances, we will make reasonable efforts to provide you with
    advance notice of such change. We may cancel or suspend your use of the
    OneDrive APIs at any time in our sole and absolute discretion. Our
    cancellation or suspension may be without cause and/or without notice. Upon
    cancellation or suspension, your right to use any and all of the foregoing
    stops right away.

    Any OneDrive APIs or Microsoft Services designated pre-release services or
    APIs (such as through use of the terms "Preview" or "Beta") may not work
    the way a final version will. We may change them for any final, commercial
    version. We also may not release a commercial version.

13. **Entire Agreement.** This Agreement and any other agreements or documents
    incorporated by reference or otherwise made applicable by this Agreement,
    constitute the entire Agreement between you and us regarding your use of
    the OneDrive APIs. It supersedes any prior contract or statements regarding
    your use of the Microsoft Services. If you have confidentiality obligations
    related to the OneDrive APIs, or Microsoft Services, those obligations
    remain in force (for example, if you were a beta tester).

14. **Assignment.** We may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any
    time with or without notice to you. You may not assign this Agreement, or
    any part of it, to any other person without our prior written consent,
    which will not be unreasonably withheld. Any attempt by you to do so is
    void. You may not transfer to anyone else, either temporarily or
    permanently, any rights to use the OneDrive APIs, or Microsoft Services.

15. **Limitation on Claims.** Any claim related to this Agreement, or the
    OneDrive APIs may not be brought unless brought within one year. The
    one-year period begins on the date when the claim first could be filed. If
    it is not filed, then that claim is permanently barred. This applies to you
    and your successors. It also applies to us and our successors and assigns.

16. **Notices; Consent Regarding Electronic Information.**

    This Agreement is in electronic form, and we have the right to send you
    certain additional information. There may be other information regarding
    the OneDrive APIs that the law requires us to send you. We may send you
    this information in electronic form. You have the right to withdraw this
    consent but, if you do, we may cancel your Services. As long as you can
    access and use the OneDrive APIs, you will ensure that you have the
    necessary software and hardware to receive these notices. If you do not
    consent to receive any notices electronically, you must stop using the
    OneDrive APIs. You will be deemed to have received a notice from us on the
    date that we electronically send it or post it.

17. **Severability.** If a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision
    of this Agreement to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
    provisions will remain in full force and effect, and will be construed so
    as to most nearly reflect the parties’ intent with respect to such provision.

18. **Governing Law and Jurisdiction.** The laws of the State of Washington
    govern this Agreement without regard to conflict of law provisions. All
    other claims, including claims regarding consumer protection laws, unfair
    competition laws and in tort, will be subject to the laws of your state of
    residence in the United States, or if you live outside the United States,
    the laws of the country to which we direct your service. You and we
    irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state
    or federal courts in King County, Washington, USA for all disputes arising
    out of or relating to this Agreement.
