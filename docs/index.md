# OneDrive developer platform

The OneDrive developer platform provides services and tools to connect your application to files across Office 365, including:

* **OneDrive personal**
* **OneDrive for Business**
* **SharePoint Online**
* **SharePoint Server 2016**

The OneDrive developer platform allows your solution to work with files across the Office 365 ecosystem and write the same code to enable solutions for consumers to enterprise customers.
OneDrive APIs are a part of the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com), a common API for Microsoft services.

Our platform consists of several components, designed to build on one another to making building apps and solutions easy.

* [Microsoft Graph SDKs](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/code-samples-and-sdks), a set of client libraries which make accessing files from the Microsoft Graph straightforward.
* [Microsoft Graph APIs](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/overview), a collection of REST APIs your app can call directly instead of using an SDK.
* [OneDrive file pickers](controls/index.md), which enable your app to open and save from OneDrive using the native OneDrive user experience and minimal code.
* [Office 365 file handlers](file-handlers/index.md), which enable your app to integrate into the OneDrive and SharePoint files experience.
