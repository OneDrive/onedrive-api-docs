# OneDrive & SharePoint developer platform

The OneDrive & SharePoint developer platform provides the APIs, components, and tools to access files and content across Microsoft 365, including:

* **OneDrive personal**
* **OneDrive for Business**
* **SharePoint Online**

The OneDrive & SharePoint (ODSP) developer platform allows your solution to use common patterns to access files across the Microsoft 365 ecosystem enabling solutions for consumer and enterprise customers. ODSP APIs are a part of the [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.com), a common API for all Microsoft services.

Our developer content is designed to help you learn how and why to integrate with OneDrive so that you can quickly get your solution running.

## Microsoft Graph

The best way to connect to OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, and SharePoint document libraries is the Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph provides a single API endpoint for accessing a variety of Microsoft services, and makes it easy to interconnect between different services.

View the [API Reference](rest-api/index.md) for the complete details on accessing OneDrive and SharePoint via Microsoft Graph.

To learn more about Microsoft Graph, visit the [Microsoft Graph developer portal](https://graph.microsoft.com).

OneDrive API is also available directly with SharePoint Server 2016.
Learn more about using OneDrive API with SharePoint Server 2016 in the [release notes](rest-api/getting-started/release-notes.md).

## Service Integrations

### File Picker

ODSP offers the [file picker shared control](controls/file-pickers/index.md), which makes it quick and easy to access files stored in OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint sites from within your application.

Using the file picker, you can connect your existing application in a matter of minutes, while enabling a whole new scenario for your users.

### Integrate your app within SharePoint and OneDrive

__SharePoint Framwork__

Using the [SharePoint Framework](https://aka.ms/spfx) you can make use of capabilities like [viva connections dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/viva/get-started/build-first-sharepoint-adaptive-card-extension), [list view command sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/extensions/get-started/building-simple-cmdset-with-dialog-api), [webparts](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/overview-client-side-web-parts), and [framework extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/extensions/overview-extensions) embed your solution's capabilities directly within SharePoint, Teams, and Microsoft Viva.

__File Handler__

Building an [Office 365 file handler](./file-handlers/index.md) brings your application into the OneDrive and SharePoint user experience. File handlers give your app the ability to provide new capabilities for creating, previewing, opening, or manipulate files stored across Microsoft 365.
