# OneDrive file picker for JavaScript v7.2 overview

The OneDrive file picker makes it easy for your web app to connect to content stored in OneDrive and SharePoint.
Using the file picker you can open, save, and share files stored in OneDrive or SharePoint without writing custom file UI code. 
 
You can use the file picker SDK to integrate with OneDrive and SharePoint in the following ways:

* Open a file and receive a short-lived URL to download the content of the file.
* Create a long-lived sharable link to view or edit a file. These are designed to be sent or shared with co-workers, friends and family, or other individuals.
* Get a direct link to the file which requires end user authorization.
* Get a file or folder ID for a file that can be used with Microsoft Graph to perform actions on the file.
* Save a file to OneDrive or SharePoint team site.

## Setting up

To get started you need to register your application and receive an app ID
from the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com).

1. Log in to the [Microsoft Application Registration Portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com)
   using your Microsoft account, or a work or school account.
2. Click **Add an app** and enter a name for your app.
3. After your application is created, configure it to support the JavaScript picker:
   1. Click **Generate New Password** to create an **Application secret**. While this value is not necessary for the picker, it must have been created.
   2. Click **Add Platform** and then select **Web**.
   3. Enter one or more **URLs** where the picker will be hosted on your website. Each page that hosts the picker needs to have a redirect URL provided.
   4. Click the **Save** button to save your changes.
4. Copy the Application Id for your application and use it in the JavaScript options object you provided to [open](open-file.md) or [save](save-file.md) a file.
