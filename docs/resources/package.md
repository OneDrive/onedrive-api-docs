# Package facet

The **Package** facet indicates that an item is the top level item in a "package" or
a collection of items, that are treated as a collection of data instead of
individual items.

An example of a package is a OneNote notebook. While the notebook is made up
of files and folders that represent the contents of the notebook, the top level
item that represents the notebook has a **Package** facet to indicate to clients
that this is a collection of data that should be treated special.

Items with the **Package** facet do not include a **Folder** or **File** facet
but are conceptually similar to an item with a **Folder** facet.
