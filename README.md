# OneDrive API Documentation

This repository is home to the OneDrive developer documentation.
This includes documentation for a portion of the Microsoft Graph that accesses OneDrive and SharePoint content, and documentation for Office 365 file handlers and file pickers.

For easier navigation of content, we recommend consuming this content from the [OneDrive Developer Portal](https://developers.microsoft.com/onedrive) or from [https://docs.microsoft.com/onedrive/developer](https://docs.microsoft.com/onedrive/developer).

## Contribute to OneDrive developer documentation

We welcome contributions from our community (users, customers, partners, MSFT employees, etc.)
How you contribute depends on who you are:

* **Community - minor updates**: If you are contributing minor updates out of the goodness of your heart, you can find the article in this repository, or visit the article on [https://docs.microsoft.com/onedrive/developer](https://docs.microsoft.com/onedrive/developer) and click the **Edit** link in the article that goes to the GitHub source for the article.
Then, just use the GitHub UI to make your updates.
Or, you are welcome to fork the repository and submit updates from your fork.

* **Community - new articles**: If you're part of the OneDrive or SharePoint community and you want to create a new article, you need to work with an employee to help bring that new content in through a combination of work in the public and private repository.

* **Employees**: If you are a technical writer, program manager, or developer from the product team and it's your job to contribute to or author technical articles, you should use the repository in our Visual Studio instance.
If you are making substantial changes to an existing article, adding or changing images, or contributing a new article, you need to fork this repository, install Git, a markdown editor, and learn some git commands.

The *\docs* folder contains the *\media* folder for root directory article media files, such as inline images.
