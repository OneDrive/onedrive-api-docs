# Drive resource

The drive resource is the top level object within a user's OneDrive.
A user will always have at least one Drive available--the default Drive.
The drive resource also represents a document library in a SharePoint site or
Office 365 group.

## Tasks on Drive resources

The following tasks are available for drive resources.

| Common task                                             | HTTP method                   |
|:--------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------|
| [Get user's default Drive metadata][drive-default]      | `GET /drive`                  |
| [Get Drive metadata of another Drive][drive-get]        | `GET /drives/{drive-id}`      |
| [Get root folder for user's default Drive][item-get]    | `GET /drive/root`             |
| [List children under the Drive][item-children]          | `GET /drive/root/children`    |
| [List changes for all Items in the Drive][item-changes] | `GET /drive/root/delta`  |
| [Search for Items in the Drive][item-search]            | `GET /drive/root/search` |
| [Access special folder](../items/special_folders.md)    | `GET /drive/special/{name}`   |

In the previous table, the examples use `/drive`, but `/drives/{drive-id}` is valid too.

## JSON representation

<!-- { "blockType": "resource", "@odata.type": "oneDrive.drive",
       "keyProperty": "id", "optionalProperties": [ "items", "root", "special"] } -->
```json

  "id": "string",
  "driveType": "personal | business | documentLibrary",
  "owner": { "@odata.type": "oneDrive.identitySet" },
  "quota": { "@odata.type": "oneDrive.quota" },

  "items": [ { "@odata.type": "oneDrive.item" } ],
  "root": { "@odata.type": "oneDrive.item" },
  "special": [ { "@odata.type": "oneDrive.item" }]
}
```

## Properties

The Drive resource has these properties.

| Property name | Type                        | Description                                                                                          |

| **driveType** | string                      | Enumerated value that identifies the type of drive account. OneDrive drives will show as `personal`, OneDrive for Business as `business` and SharePoint document libraries as `documentLibrary`. |
| **owner**     | [IdentitySet][identity-set] | The user account that owns the drive. Owner may not be available in all scenarios, depending on permissions granted to the application.                                                                |
