# Adding a new subscription

To add a new subscription, your app posts a request to the subscription
collection that includes the properties of the subscription you want to
have created.

**Note:** OneDrive for Business and SharePoint document libraries can only have
subscriptions created on the drive's root item.

## Prerequisites
To create a subscription the app must have read access to the item being subscribed to.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
POST /subscriptions
```

### Example

<!-- {
"blockType": "request",
"name": "add-subscription-graph",
"@odata.type": "oneDrive.subscription",
"scopes": "service.graph"
} -->
```http
POST /subscriptions
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "notificationUrl": "https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/api/webhook-receiver",
 "expirationDateTime": "2016-01-01T11:23:00.000Z",
 "resource": "/me/drive/root",
 "changeType": "updated",
 "clientState": "client-specific string"
}
```

## Response

If the subscription is added, then a `201 Created` response is returned that
includes the newly created subscription object.

<!-- {
"blockType": "response",
"@odata.type": "oneDrive.subscription"
} -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "subscriptionId": "1039149811asbc",
    "resource": "/me/drive/root",
    "notificationUrl": "https://contoso.azurewebsites.net/api/webhook-receiver",
    "changeType": "updated",
    "expirationDateTime": "2016-01-01T11:23:00.000Z",
    "clientState": "client-specific string"
}
```

## URL validation

Before a new subscription is created, Microsoft Graph will send a request to the
URL provided in the request to create a new subscription. Your service must
respond to this request by returning the validation key.

If your service fails to validate the request in this way, the subscription
will fail to be created.

See [handling webhook validation requests](webhook-validation.md) for detailed
information.

### Error responses

See [Error Responses][error-response] for more info about
how errors are returned.
