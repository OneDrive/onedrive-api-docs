# Deleting a subscription

Remove a subscription from an item. Note that after deleting the subscription
the subscription will no longer exist and additional notifications will not
be delivered.

## Prerequisites
To modify a subscription the app must have read-write access to the item the
subscription exists on.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
DELETE /subscriptions/{id}
```

### Example

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "delete-subscription-graph", "scopes": "service.graph" } -->
```http
DELETE /subscriptions/{id}
```

## Response

If the subscription is found and successfully deleted, then a `204 No Content`
response is returned:

<!-- { "blockType": "response" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
```
