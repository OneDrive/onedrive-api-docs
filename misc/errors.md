# Error response

Errors are returned using standard HTTP error code syntax. The following
HTTP status codes should be expected.

| Status code | Status message                  | Description                                                                                                             |

The error response is a single JSON object. The object contains a single
property named **error**, which includes all of the details of the error message.
Additional information is included in the body of the failed call. Here is an example
of a full JSON error body.

**Note**: The **innererror** object is recursive, i.e., it can also have an **innererror** property. 

<!-- { "blockType": "example", "@odata.type": "oneDrive.error" } -->
```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalidRange",
    "message": "Uploaded fragment overlaps with existing data.",
    "innererror": {
      "code": "fragmentOverlap"
    }
  }
}

```

**Important:** Error messages are not localized and are intended for the developer
to reference. They shouldn't be displayed directly to the user.
